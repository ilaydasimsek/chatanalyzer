 Bilbo got up and bowed. 'I am flattered, Lindir,’ he said. 'But it
would be too tiring to repeat it all.' 'Not too tiring for you,' the Elves answered laughing. 'You know you
are never tired of reciting your own verses. But really we cannot answer
your question at one hearing!' 'What!' cried Bilbo. 'You can't tell which parts were mine, and which
were the D®nadan's?' 'It is not easy for us to tell the difference between two mortals' said
the Elf. 'Nonsense, Lindir,' snorted Bilbo. 'If you can't distinguish between a
Man and a Hobbit, your judgement is poorer than I imagined. They're as
different as peas and apples.' 'Maybe. To sheep other sheep no doubt appear different,' laughed
Lindir. 'Or to shepherds. But Mortals have not been our study. We have other
business.' 'I won't argue with you,' said Bilbo. 'I am sleepy after so much music
and singing. I'll leave you to guess, if you want to.' He got up and came towards Frodo. 'Well, that's over,' he said in a low
voice. 'It went off better than I expected. I don't often get asked for a
second hearing. What did you think of it?' 'I am not going to try and guess,' said Frodo smiling. 'You needn't,’ said Bilbo. 'As a matter of fact it was all mine. Except
that Aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone. He seemed to think it
important. I don't know why. Otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing
rather above my head, and he said that if I had the cheek to make verses
about Edrendil in the house of Elrond, it was my affair. I suppose he was
right.' 'I don't know,' said Frodo. 'It seemed to me to fit somehow, though I
can't explain. I was half asleep when you began, and it seemed to follow on
from something that I was dreaming about. I didn't understand that it was
really you speaking until near the end.' 'It is difficult to keep awake here, until you get used to it;' said
Bilbo. 'Not that hobbits would ever acquire quite the elvish appetite for
music and poetry and tales. They seem to like them as much as food, or more.
They will be going on for a long time yet. What do you say to slipping off
for some more quiet talk?' 'Can we?’ said Frodo. 'Of course. This is merrymaking not business. Come and go as you like,
as long as you don't make a noise.' They got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows, and made for the
doors. Sam they left behind, fast asleep still with a smile on his face. In
spite of his delight in Bilbo's company Frodo felt a tug of regret as they
passed out of the Hall of Fire. Even as they stepped over the threshold a
single clear voice rose in song. A Elbereth Gilthoniel,
silivren penna mnriel
o menel aglar elenath! Na-chaered palan-dnriel
o galadhremmin ennorath, Fanuilos, le linnathon
nef aear, sn nef aearon! Frodo halted for a moment, looking back. Elrond was in his chair and
the fire was on his face like summer -light upon the trees. Near him sat the
Lady Arwen. To his surprise Frodo saw that Aragorn stood beside her; his
dark cloak was thrown back, and he seemed to be clad in elven-mail, and a
star shone on his breast. They spoke together, and then suddenly it seemed
to Frodo that Arwen turned towards him, and the light of her eyes fell on
him from afar and pierced his heart. He stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the elvish song
fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody. ' It is a song to
Elbereth,' said Bilbo. 'They will sing that, and other songs of the Blessed
Realm, many times tonight. Come on!' He led Frodo back to his own little room. It opened on to the gar dens
and looked south across the ravine of the Bruinen. There they sat for some
while, looking through the window at the bright stars above the
steep-climbing woods, and talking softly. They spoke no more of the small
news of the Shire far away, nor of the dark shadows and perils that
encompassed them, but of the fair things they had seen in the world
together, of the Elves, of the stars, of trees, and the gentle fall of the
bright year in the woods. At last there came a knock on the door. 'Begging your pardon,’ said
Sam, putting in his head, 'but I was just wondering if you would be wanting
anything.' 'And begging yours, Sam Gamgee,' replied Bilbo. 'I guess you mean that
it is time your master went to bed.'
'Well, sir, there is a Council early tomorrow, I hear and he only got
up today for the first time.' 'Quite right, Sam,' laughed Bilbo. 'You can trot off and tell Gandalf
that he has gone to bed. Good night, Frodo! Bless me, but it has been good
to see you again! There are no folk like hobbits after all for a real good
talk. I am getting very old, and I began to wonder if I should ever live to
see your chapters of our story. Good night! I'll take a walk, I think, and
look at the stars of Elbereth in the garden. Sleep well!'
Chapter 2 . The Council of Elrond Next day Frodo woke early, feeling refreshed and well. He walked along
the terraces above the loud-flowing Bruinen and watched the pale, cool sun
rise above the far mountains, and shine down. Slanting through the thin
silver mist; the dew upon the yellow leaves was glimmering, and the woven
nets of gossamer twinkled on every bush. Sam walked beside him, saying
nothing, but sniffing the air, and looking every now and again with wonder
in his eyes at the great heights in the East. The snow was white upon their
peaks. On a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon
Gandalf and Bilbo deep in talk. 'Hullo! Good morning!' said Bilbo. 'Feel
ready for the great council?’ 'I feel ready for anything,' answered Frodo. 'But most of all I should
like to go walking today and explore the valley. I should like to get into
those pine- woods up there.' He pointed away far up the side of Rivendell to
the north. 'You may have a chance later,' said Gandalf. 'But we cannot make any
plans yet. There is much to hear and decide today.' Suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out. 'That is
the warning bell for the Council of Elrond,' cried Gandalf. 'Come along now!
Both you and Bilbo are wanted.' Frodo and Bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back
to the house; behind them, uninvited and for the moment forgotten, trotted
Sam. Gandalf led them to the porch where Frodo had found his friends the
evening before. The light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the
valley. The noise of bubbling waters came up from the foaming river-bed.
Birds were singing, and a wholesome peace lay on the land. To Frodo his
dangerous flight, and the rumours of the darkness growing in the world
outside, already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream; but the faces
that were turned to meet them as they entered were grave. Elrond was there, and several others were seated in silence about him.
Frodo saw Glorfindel and Gluin; and in a corner alone Strider was sitting,
clad in his old travel-worn clothes again. Elrond drew Frodo to a seat by
his side, and presented him to the company, saying: 'Here, my friends is the hobbit, Frodo son of Drogo. Few have ever come
hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent.' He then pointed out and named those whom Frodo had not met before.
There was a younger dwarf at Gluin's side: his son Gimli. Beside Glorfindel
there were several other counsellors of Elrond's household, of whom Erestor
was the chief; and with him was Galdor, an Elf from the Grey Havens who had
come on an errand from Cnrdan the Shipwright. There was also a strange Elf
clad in green and brown, Legolas, a messenger from his father, Thranduil,
the King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood. And seated a little apart was a
tall man with a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed, proud and
stern of glance. He was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on horseback; and indeed
though his garments were rich, and his cloak was lined with fur, they were
stained with long travel. He had a collar of silver in which a single white
stone was set; his locks were shorn about his shoulders. On a baldric he
wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees. He
gazed at Frodo and Bilbo with sudden wonder. 'Here,' said Elrond, turning to Gandalf, 'is Boromir, a man from the
South. He arrived in the grey morning, and seeks for counsel. I have bidden
him to be present, for here his questions will be answered.' Not all that was spoken and debated in the Council need now be told.
Much was said of events in the world outside, especially in the South, and
in the wide lands east of the Mountains. Of these things Frodo had already
heard many rumours; but the tale of Gluin was new to him, and when the dwarf
spoke he listened attentively. It appeared that amid the splendour of their
works of hand the hearts of the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were
troubled. 'It is now many years ago,' said Gluin, 'that a shadow of disquiet fell
upon our people. Whence it came we did not at first perceive. Words began to
be whispered in secret-: it was said that we were hemmed in a narrow place,
and that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world. Some
spoke of Moria: the mighty works of our fathers that are called in our own
tongue Khazad-dym; and they declared that now at last we had the power and
numbers to return.' Gluin sighed. 'Moria! Moria! Wonder of the Northern world! Too deep we
delved there, and woke the nameless fear. Long have its vast mansions lain
empty since the children of Durin fled. But now we spoke of it again with
longing, and yet with dread; for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of
Khazad-dym for many lives of kings, save Thrur only, and he perished. At
last, however, Balin listened to the whispers, and resolved to go; and
though Dbin did not give leave willingly, he took with him Ori and Uin and
many of our folk, and they went away south. "That was nigh on thirty years ago. For a while we had news and it
seemed good: messages reported that Moria had been entered and a great work
begun there. Then there was silence, and no word has ever come from Moria
since. "Then about a year ago a messenger came to Dbin, but not from
Moria -from Mordor: a horseman in the night, who called Dbin to his gate. The
Lord Sauron the Great, so he said, wished for our friendship. Rings he would
give for it, such as he gave of old. And he asked urgently concerning
hobbits, of what kind they were, and where they dwelt. "For Sauron knows,"
said he, "that one of these was known to you on a time." 'At this we were greatly troubled, and we gave no answer. And then his
fell voice was lowered, and he would have sweetened it if he could. "As a
small token only of your friendship Sauron asks this," he said: "that you
should find this thief," such was his word, "and get from him, willing or
no, a little ring, the least of rings, that once he stole. It is but a
trifle that Sauron fancies, and an earnest of your good will. Find it, and
three rings that the Dwarf sires possessed of old shall be returned to you,
and the realm of Moria shall be yours for ever. Find only news of the thief,
whether he still lives and where, and you shall have great reward and
lasting friendship from the Lord. Refuse, and things will not seem so well. Do you refuse?" 'At that his breath came like the hiss of snakes, and all who stood by
shuddered, but Dbin said: "I say neither yea nor nay. I must consider this
message and what it means under its fair cloak." ' "Consider well, but not too long," said he. " "The time of my thought is my own to spend," answered Dbin. ' "For the present," said he, and rode into the darkness. 'Heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that night. We
needed not the fell voice of the messenger to warn us that his words held
both menace and deceit; for we knew already that the power that has
re-entered Mordor has not changed, and ever it betrayed us of old. Twice the
messenger has returned, and has gone unanswered. The third and last time, so
he says, is soon to come, before the ending of the year. 'And so I have been sent at last by Dbin to warn Bilbo that he is
sought by the Enemy, and to learn, if may be, why he desires this ring, this
least of rings. Also we crave the advice of Elrond. For the Shadow grows and
draws nearer. We discover that messengers have come also to King Brand in
Dale, and that he is afraid. We fear that he may yield. Already war is
gathering on his eastern borders. If we make no answer, the Enemy may move
Men of his rule to assail King Brand, and Dbin also.' 'You have done well to come,' said Elrond. 'You will hear today all
that you need in order to understand the purposes of the Enemy. There is
naught that you can do, other than to resist, with hope or without it. But
you do not stand alone. You will learn that your trouble is but part of the
trouble of all the western world. The Ring ! What shall we do with the Ring,
the least of rings, the trifle that Sauron fancies? That is the doom that we
must deem. 'That is the purpose for which you are called hither. Called, I say.
though I have not called you to me, strangers from distant lands. You have
come and are here met, in this very nick of time, by chance as it may seem. Yet it is not so. Believe rather that it is so ordered that we, who sit
here, and none others, must now find counsel for the peril of the world. 'Now, therefore, things shall be openly spoken that have been hidden
from all but a few until this day. And first, so that all may understand
what is the peril, the Tale of the Ring shall be told from the beginning
even to this present. And I will begin that tale, though others shall end
it.' Then all listened while Elrond in his clear voice spoke of Sauron and
the Rings of Power, and their forging in the Second Age of the world long
ago. A part of his tale was known to some there, but the full tale to none,
and many eyes were turned t= Elrond in fear and wonder as he told of the
Elven-smiths of Eregion and their friendship with Moria, and their eagerness
for knowledge, by which Sauron ensnared them. For in that time he was not
yet evil to behold, and they received his aid and grew mighty in craft,
whereas he learned all their secrets, and betrayed them, and forged secretly
in the Mountain of Fire the One Ring to be their master. But Celebrimbor was
aware of him, and hid the Three which he had made; and there was war, and
the land was laid waste, and the gate of Moria was shut.
Then through all the years that followed he traced the Ring; but since
that history is elsewhere recounted, even as Elrond himself set it down in
his books of lore, it is not here recalled. For it is a long tale, full of
deeds great and terrible, and briefly though Elrond spoke, the sun rode up
the sky, and the morning was passing ere he ceased. Of N®menor he spoke, its glory and its fall, and the return of the
Kings of Men to Middle-earth out of the deeps of the Sea, borne upon the
wings of storm. Then Elendil the Tall and his mighty sons, Isildur and
Anbrion, became great lords; and the North-realm they made in Arnor, and the
South-realm in Gondor above the mouths of Anduin. But Sauron of Mordor
assailed them, and they made the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and the
hosts of Gil-galad and Elendil were mustered in Arnor. Thereupon Elrond paused a while and sighed. 'I remember well the
splendour of their banners,' he said. v It recalled to me the glory of the
Elder Days and the hosts of Beleriand, so many great princes and captains
were assembled. And yet not so many, nor so fair, as when Thangorodrim was
broken, and the Elves deemed that evil was ended for ever, and it was not
so.' 'You remember?’ said Frodo, speaking his thought aloud in his
astonishment. 'But I thought,' he stammered as Elrond turned towards him, 'I
thought that the fall of Gil-galad was a long age ago.' 'So it was indeed,' answered Elrond gravely. 'But my memory reaches
back even to the Elder Days. Edrendil was my sire, who was born in Gondolin
before its fall; and my mother was Elwing, daughter of Dior, son of L®thien
of Doriath. I have seen three ages in the West of the world, and many
defeats, and many fruitless victories. 'I was the herald of Gil-galad and marched with his host. I was at the
Battle of Dagorlad before the Black Gate of Mordor, where we had the
mastery: for the Spear of Gil-galad and the Sword of Elendil, Aiglos and
Narsil, none could withstand. I beheld the last combat on the slopes of
Orodruin, where Gil-galad died, and Elendil fell, and Narsil broke beneath
him; but Sauron himself was overthrown, and Isildur cut the Ring from his
hand with the hilt-shard of his father's sword, and took it for his own.' At this the stranger, Boromir, broke in. 'So that is what became of the
Ring!' he cried. 'If ever such a tale was told in the South, it has long
been forgotten. I have heard of the Great Ring of him that we do not name;
but we believed that it perished from the world in the ruin of his first
realm. Isildur took it! That is tidings indeed.' 'Alas! yes,' said Elrond. 'Isildur took it, as should not have been. It
should have been cast then into Orodruin's fire nigh at hand where it was
made. But few marked what Isildur did. He alone stood by his father in that
last mortal contest; and by Gil-galad only Cnrdan stood, and I. But Isildur
would not listen to our counsel. ’ "This I will have as weregild for my father, and my brother," he
said; and therefore whether we would or no, he took it to treasure it. But
soon he was betrayed by it to his death; and so it is named in the North
Isildur's Bane. Yet death maybe was better than what else might have
befallen him. 'Only to the North did these tidings come, and only to a few. Small
wonder it is that you have not heard them, Boromir. From the ruin of the
Gladden Fields, where Isildur perished, three men only came ever back over
the mountains after long wandering. One of these was Ohtar, the esquire of
Isildur, who bore the shards of the sword of Elendil; and he brought them to
Valandil, the heir of Isildur, who being but a child had remained here in
Rivendell. But Narsil was broken and its light extinguished, and it has not
yet been forged again. 'Fruitless did I call the victory of the Fast Alliance? Not wholly so,
yet it did not achieve its end. Sauron was diminished, but not destroyed. His Ring was lost but not unmade. The Dark Tower was broken, but its
foundations were not removed; for they were made with the power of the Ring,
and while it remains they will endure. Many Elves and many mighty Men,
and many of their friends, had perished in the war. Anbrion was slain, and
Isildur was slain; and Gil-galad and Elendil were no more. Never again shall
there be any such league of Elves and Men; for Men multiply and the
Firstborn decrease, and the two kindreds are estranged. And ever since that
day the race of N®menor has decayed, and the span of their years has
lessened. 'In the North after the war and the slaughter of the Gladden Fields the
Men of Westernesse were diminished, and their city of Ann®minas beside
Fake Evendim fell into ruin; and the heirs of Valandil removed and dwelt at
Fornost on the high North Downs, and that now too is desolate. Men call it
Deadmen's Dike, and they fear to tread there. For the folk of Arnor
dwindled, and their foes devoured them, and their lordship passed, leaving
only green mounds in the grassy hills. 'In the South the realm of Gondor long endured; and for a while its
splendour grew, recalling somewhat of the might of N®menor, ere it fell.
High towers that people built, and strong places, and havens of many ships;
and the winged crown of the Kings of Men was held in awe by folk of many
tongues. Their chief city was Osgiliath, Citadel of the Stars, through the
midst of which the River flowed. And Minas Ithil they built, Tower of the
Rising Moon, eastward upon a shoulder of the Mountains of Shadow; and
westward at the feet of the White Mountains Minas Anor they made, Tower of
the Setting Sun. There in the courts of the King grew a white tree, from the
seed of that tree which Isildur brought over the deep waters, and the seed
of that tree before came from Eressla, and before that out of the Uttermost
West in the Day before days when the world was young. 'But in the wearing of the swift years of Middle-earth the line of
Meneldil son of Anbrion failed, and the Tree withered, and the blood of the
N®menoreans became mingled with that of lesser men. Then the watch upon
the walls of Mordor slept, and dark things crept back to Gorgoroth. And on a
time evil things came forth, and they took Minas Ithil and abode in it, and
they made it into a place of dread; and it is called Minas Morgul, the Tower
of Sorcery. Then Minas Anor was named anew Minas Tirith, the Tower of
Guard; and these two cities were ever at war, but Osgiliath which lay between was
deserted and in its ruins shadows walked. 'So it has been for many lives of men. But the Lords of Minas Tirith
still fight on, defying our enemies, keeping the passage of the River from
Argonath to the Sea. And now that part of the tale that I shall tell is
drawn to its close. For in the days of Isildur the Ruling Ring passed out of
all knowledge, and the Three were released from its dominion. But now in
this latter day they are in peril once more, for to our sorrow the One has
been found. Others shall speak of its finding, for in that I played small
part.' He ceased, but at once Boromir stood up, tall and proud, before them. Give me leave, Master Elrond, said he, first to say more of Gondor; for
verily from the land of Gondor I am come. And it would be well for all to
know what passes there. For few, I deem, know of our deeds, and therefore
guess little of their peril, if we should fail at last. 'Believe not that in the land of Gondor the blood of N®menor is spent,
nor all its pride and dignity forgotten. By our valour the wild folk of the
East are still restrained, and the terror of Morgul kept at bay; and thus
alone are peace and freedom maintained in the lands behind us, bulwark of
the West. But if the passages of the River should be won, what then? 'Yet that hour, maybe, is not now far away. The Nameless Enemy has
arisen again. Smoke rises once more from Orodruin that we call Mount
Doom. The power of the Black Land grows and we are hard beset. When the
Enemy returned our folk were driven from Ithilien, our fair domain east of the
River, though we kept a foothold there and strength of arms. But this very
year, in the days of June, sudden war came upon us out of Mordor, and we
were swept away. We were outnumbered, for Mordor has allied itself with the
Easterlings and the cruel Elaradrim; but it was not by numbers that we were
defeated. A power was there that we have not felt before. 'Some said that it could be seen, like a great black horseman, a dark
shadow under the moon. Wherever he came a madness filled our foes, but fear
fell on our boldest, so that horse and man gave way and fled. Only a remnant
of our eastern force came back, destroying the last bridge that still stood
amid the ruins of Osgiliath. ’I was in the company that held the bridge, until it was cast down
behind us. Four only were saved by swimming: my brother and myself and
two others. But still we fight on, holding all the west shores of Anduin; and
those who shelter behind us give us praise, if ever they hear our name: much
praise but little help. Only from Rohan now will any men ride to us when we
call. 'In this evil hour I have come on an errand over many dangerous leagues
to Elrond: a hundred and ten days I have journeyed all alone. But I do not
seek allies in war. The might of Elrond is in wisdom not in weapons, it is
said. I come to ask for counsel and the unravelling of hard words. For on
the eve of the sudden assault a dream came to my brother in a troubled
sleep; and afterwards a like dream came oft to him again, and once to me. ’In that dream I thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a
growing thunder, but in the West a pale light lingered, and out of it I
heard a voice, remote but clear, crying: Seek for the Sword that was broken: In Imladris it dwells; There shall be counsels taken
Stronger than Morgul-spells. There shall be shown a token
That Doom is near at hand, For Isildur's Bane shall waken, And the Halfling forth shall stand. Of these words we could understand little, and we spoke to our father,
Denethor, Lord of Minas Tirith, wise in the lore of Gondor. This only would
he say, that Imladris was of old the name among the Elves of a far northern
dale, where Elrond the Halfelven dwelt, greatest of lore-masters. Therefore
my brother, seeing how desperate was our need, was eager to heed the dream
and seek for Imladris; but since the way was full of doubt and danger, I
took the journey upon myself. Loth was my father to give me leave, and long
have I wandered by roads forgotten, seeking the house of Elrond, of which
many had heard, but few knew where it lay.’ 'And here in the house of Elrond more shall be made clear to you' said
Aragorn, standing up. He cast his sword upon the table that stood before
Elrond, and the blade was in two pieces. 'Here is the Sword that was
Broken!' he said. 'And who are you, and what have you to do with Minas Tirith?’ asked
Boromir, looking in wonder at the lean face of the Ranger and his
weather-stained cloak. 'He is Aragorn son of Arathorn,' said Elrond; 'and he is descended
through many fathers from Isildur Elendil's son of Minas Ithil. He is the
Chief of the D®nedain in the North, and few are now left of that folk.’ 'Then it belongs to you, and not to me at all!' cried Frodo in
amazement, springing to his feet, as if he expected the Ring to be demanded
at once. 'It does not belong to either of us,' said Aragorn; 'but it has been
ordained that you should hold it for a while.' 'Bring out the Ring, Frodo!' said Gandalf solemnly. 'The time has come.
Hold it up, and then Boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle.' There was a hush, and all turned their eyes on Frodo. He was shaken by
a sudden shame and fear; and he felt a great reluctance to reveal the Ring,
and a loathing of its touch. He wished he was far away. The Ring gleamed and
flickered as he held it up before them in his trembling hand. 'Behold Isildur's Bane!' said Elrond. Boromir's eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing. 'The Halfling!'
he muttered. 'Is then the doom of Minas Tirith come at last? But why then
should we seek a broken sword?’ ’The words were not the doom of Minas Tirith ,’ said Aragorn. 'But doom
and great deeds are indeed at hand. For the Sword that was Broken is the
Sword of Elendil that broke beneath him when he fell. It has been treasured
by his heirs when all other heirlooms were lost; for it was spoken of old
among us that it should be made again when the Ring, Isildur's Bane, was
found. Now you have seen the sword that you have sought, what would you
ask? Do you wish for the House of Elendil to return to the Land of Gondor?' 'I was not sent to beg any boon, but to seek only the meaning of a
riddle,' answered Boromir proudly. 'Yet we are hard pressed, and the Sword
of Elendil would be a help beyond our hope-if such a thing could indeed
return out of the shadows of the past.' He looked again at Aragorn, and
doubt was in his eyes. Frodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently at his side. Evidently he was annoyed
on his friend's behalf. Standing suddenly up he burst out: All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost. From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be blade that was broken: The crownless again shall be king. 'Not very good perhaps, but to the point — if you need more beyond the
word of Elrond. If that was worth a journey of a hundred and ten days to
hear, you had best listen to it.' He sat down with a snort. 'I made that up myself,' he whispered to Frodo, 'for the D®nadan, a
long time ago when he first told me about himself. I almost wish that my
adventures were not over, and that I could go with him when his day comes.' Aragorn smiled at him; then he turned to Boromir again. 'For my part I
forgive your doubt,' he said. 'Little do I resemble the figures of Elendil
and Isildur as they stand carven in their majesty in the halls of Denethor. I am but the heir of Isildur, not Isildur himself. I have had a hard life
and a long; and the leagues that lie between here and Gondor are a small
part in the count of my journeys. I have crossed many mountains and many
rivers, and trodden many plains, even into the far countries of Rhyn and
Harad where the stars are strange. 'But my home, such as I have, is in the North. For here the heirs of
Valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto son for many
generations. Our days have darkened, and we have dwindled; but ever the
Sword has passed to a new keeper. And this I will say to you, Boromir, ere I
end. Lonely men are we, Rangers of the wild, hunters— but hunters ever of
the servants of the Enemy; for they are found in many places, not in Mordor
only. 'If Gondor, Boromir, has been a stalwart tower, we have played another
part. Many evil things there are that your strong walls and bright swords do
not stay. You know little of the lands beyond your bounds. Peace and
freedom, do you say? The North would have known them little but for us. Fear
would have destroyed them. But when dark things come from the houseless
hills, or creep from sunless woods, they fly from us. What roads would any
dare to tread, what safety would there be in quiet lands, or in the homes of
simple men at night, if the D®nedain were asleep, or were all gone into the
grave? 'And yet less thanks have we than you. Travellers scowl at us, and
countrymen give us scornful names. "Strider" I am to one fat man who lives
within a day's march of foes that would freeze his heart or lay his little
town in ruin, if he were not guarded ceaselessly. Yet we would not have it
otherwise. If simple folk are free from care and fear, simple they will be,
and we must be secret to keep them so. That has been the task of my kindred,
while the years have lengthened and the grass has grown. 'But now the world is changing once again. A new hour comes. Isildur's
Bane is found. Battle is at hand. The Sword shall be reforged. I will come
to Minas Tirith.' 'Isildur's Bane is found, you say,' said Boromir. 'I have seen a bright
ring in the Halfling's hand; but Isildur perished ere this age of the world
began, they say. How do the Wise know that this ring is his? And how has it
passed down the years, until it is brought hither by so strange a
messenger?' 'That shall be told,' said Elrond. 'But not yet, I beg, Master!’ said Bilbo. 'Already the Sun is climbing
to noon, and I feel the need of something to strengthen me.’ 'I had not named you,’ said Elrond smiling. 'But I do so now. Come! Tell us your tale. And if you have not yet cast your story into verse, you
may tell it in plain words. The briefer, the sooner shall you be refreshed.' 'Very well,' said Bilbo. 'I will do as you bid. But I will now tell the
true story, and if some here have heard me tell it otherwise' — he looked
sidelong at Gluin — l ask them to forget it and forgive me. I only wished
to claim the treasure as my very own in those days, and to be rid of the
name of thief that was put on me. But perhaps I understand things a little
better now. Anyway, this is what happened.' To some there Bilbo's tale was wholly new, and they listened with
amazement while the old hobbit, actually not at all displeased, recounted
his adventure with Gollum, at full length. He did not omit a single riddle. He would have given also an account of his party and disappearance from the
Shire, if he had been allowed; but Elrond raised his hand. 'Well told, my friend,' he said, 'but that is enough at this time. For
the moment it suffices to know that the Ring passed to Frodo, your heir. Let
him now speak!' Then, less willingly than Bilbo, Frodo told of all his dealings with
the Ring from the day that it passed into his keeping. Every step of his
journey from Hobbiton to the Ford of Bruinen was questioned and considered,
and everything that he could recall concerning the Black Riders was
examined. At last he sat down again. 'Not bad,' Bilbo said to him. 'You would have made a good story of it,
if they hadn't kept on interrupting. I tried to make a few notes, but we
shall have to go over it all again together some time, if I am to write it
up. There are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here!' 'Yes, it made quite a long tale,' answered Frodo. 'But the story still
does not seem complete to me. I still want to know a good deal, especially
about Gandalf.' Galdor of the Havens, who sat near by, overheard him. 'You speak for me
also,’ he cried, and turning to Elrond he said: 'The Wise may have good
reason to believe that the halfling's trove is indeed the Great Ring of long
debate, unlikely though that may seem to those who know less. But may we not
hear the proofs? And I would ask this also. What of Saruman? He is learned
in the lore of the Rings, yet he is not among us. What is his counsel-if he
knows the things that we have heard?' 'The questions that you ask, Galdor, are bound together,' said Elrond. I had not overlooked them, and they shall be answered. But these things it
is the part of Gandalf to make clear; and I call upon him last, for it is
the place of honour, and in all this matter he has been the chief.' 'Some, Galdor,' said Gandalf, 'would think the tidings of Gluin, and
the pursuit of Frodo, proof enough that the halfling's trove is a thing of
great worth to the Enemy. Yet it is a ring. What then? The Nine the Nazgyl
keep. The Seven are taken or destroyed.' At this Gluin stirred, but did not
speak. 'The Three we know of. What then is this one that he desires so much? 'There is indeed a wide waste of time between the River and the
Mountain, between the loss and the finding. But the gap in the knowledge of
the Wise has been filled at last. Yet too slowly. For the Enemy has been
close behind, closer even than I feared. And well is it that not until this
year, this very summer, as it seems, did he learn the full truth. 'Some here will remember that many years ago I myself dared to pass the
doors of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur, and secretly explored his ways, and
found thus that our fears were true: he was none other than Sauron, our
Enemy of old, at length taking shape and power again. Some, too, will
remember also that Saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against him, and
for long we watched him only. Yet at last, as his shadow grew, Saruman yielded,
and the Council put forth its strength and drove the evil out of Mirkwood
and that was in the very year of the finding of this Ring: a strange chance,
if chance it was. 'But we were too late, as Elrond foresaw. Sauron also had watched us,
and had long prepared against our stroke, governing Mordor from afar through
Minas Morgul, where his Nine servants dwelt, until all was ready. Then he
gave way before us, but only feigned to flee, and soon after came to the
Dark Tower and openly declared himself. Then for the last time the Council
met; for now we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the One.
We feared then that he had some news of it that we knew nothing of. But
Saruman said nay, and repeated what he had said to us before: that the One
would never again be found in Middle-earth. "At the worst," said he, "our Enemy knows that we have it not and
that it still is lost. But what was lost may yet be found, he thinks. Fear
not! His hope will cheat him. Have I not earnestly studied this matter? Into
Anduin the Great it fell; and long ago, while Sauron slept, it was rolled
down the River to the Sea. There let it lie until the End.'" Gandalf fell silent, gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of
the Misty Mountains, at whose great roots the peril of the world had so long
lain hidden. He sighed. 'There I was at fault,' he said. 'I was lulled by the words of Saruman
the Wise; but I should have sought for the truth sooner, and our peril would
now be less.’ 'We were all at fault,’ said Elrond, 'and but for your vigilance the
Darkness, maybe, would already be upon us. But say on!’ 'From the first my heart misgave me, against all reason that I knew,'
said Gandalf, 'and I desired to know how this thing came to Gollum, and how
long he had possessed it. So I set a watch for him, guessing that he would
ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure. He came, but
he escaped and was not found. And then alas ! I let the matter rest, watching
and waiting only, as we have too often done. 'Time passed with many cares, until my doubts were awakened again to
sudden fear. Whence came the hobbit's ring? What, if my fear was true,
should be done with it? Those things I must decide. But I spoke yet of my
dread to none, knowing the peril of an untimely whisper, if it went astray. In all the long wars with the Dark Tower treason has ever been our greatest
foe. 'That was seventeen years ago. Soon I became aware that spies of many
sorts, even beasts and birds, were gathered round the Shire, and my fear
grew. I called for the help of the D®nedain, and their watch was doubled;
and I opened my heart to Aragorn, the heir of Isildur.' 'And I,' said Aragorn, 'counselled that we should hunt for Gollum. too
late though it may seem. And since it seemed fit that Isildur's heir should
labour to repair Isildur's fault, I went with Gandalf on the long and
hopeless search.' Then Gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of Wilderland,
down even to the Mountains of Shadow and the fences of Mordor. 'There we
had rumour of him, and we guess that he dwelt there long in the dark hills; but
we never found him, and at last I despaired. And then in my despair I
thought again of a test that might make the finding of Gollum unneeded. The
ring itself might tell if it were the One. The memory of words at the
Council came back to me: words of Saruman, half-heeded at the time. I heard
them now clearly in my heart. ' "The Nine, the Seven, and the Three," he said, "had each their proper
gem. Not so the One. It was round and unadorned, as it were one of the
lesser rings; but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled, maybe, could
still see and read." 'What those marks were he had not said. Who now would know? The
maker. And Saruman? But great though his lore may be, it must have a source. What
hand save Sauron’s ever held this thing, ere it was lost? The hand of
Isildur alone. 'With that thought, I forsook the chase, and passed swiftly to Gondor. In former days the members of my order had been well received there, but
Saruman most of all. Often he had been for long the guest of the Lords of
the City. Less welcome did the Lord Denethor show me then than of old, and
grudgingly he permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls and books. ’ "If indeed you look only, as you say, for records of ancient days,
and the beginnings of the City, read on! " he said. "For to me what was is
less dark than what is to come, and that is my care. But unless you have
more skill even than Saruman, who has studied here long, you will find
naught that is not well known to me, who am master of the lore of this
City." 'So said Denethor. And yet there lie in his hoards many records that
few now can read, even of the lore-masters, for their scripts and tongues
have become dark to later men. And Boromir, there lies in Minas Tirith
still, unread, I guess, by any save Saruman and myself since the kings
failed, a scroll that Isildur made himself. For Isildur did not march away
straight from the war in Mordor, as some have told the tale.’ 'Some in the North, maybe,' Boromir broke in. 'All know in Gondor that
he went first to Minas Anor and dwelt a while with his nephew Meneldil,
instructing him, before he committed to him the rule of the South Kingdom.
In that time he planted there the last sapling of the White Tree in memory
of his brother.' 'But in that time also he made this scroll,' said Gandalf; 'and that is
not remembered in Gondor, it would seem. For this scroll concerns the Ring,
and thus wrote Isildur therein: The Great Ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the North Kingdom; but
records of it shall be left in Gondor, where also dwell the heirs of
Elendil, lest a time come when the memory of these great matters shall grow
dim. 'And after these words Isildur described the Ring, such as he found it. It was hot when I first took it, hot as a glede, and my hand was
scorched, so that I doubt if ever again I shall be free of the pain of it. Yet even as I write it is cooled, and it seemeth to shrink, though it loseth
neither its beauty nor its shape. Already the writing upon it, which at
first was as clear as red flame, fadeth and is now only barely to be read. It is fashioned in an elven-script of Eregion, for they have no letters in
Mordor for such subtle work; but the language is unknown to me. I deem it to
be a tongue of the Black Land, since it is foul and uncouth. What evil it
saith I do not know; but I trace here a copy of it, lest it fade beyond
recall. The Ring misseth, maybe, the heat of Sauron's hand, which was black
and yet burned like fire, and so Gil-galad was destroyed; and maybe were the
gold made hot again, the writing would be refreshed, gut for my part I will
risk no hurt to this thing: of all the works of Sauron the only fair. It is
precious to me, though I buy it with great pain. ’When I read these words, my quest was ended. For the traced writing
was indeed as Isildur guessed, in the tongue of Mordor and the servants of
the Tower. And what was said therein was already known. For in the day that
Sauron first put on the One, Celebrimbor, maker of the Three, was aware of
him, and from afar he heard him speak these words, and so his evil purposes
were revealed. 'At once I took my leave of Denethor, but even as I went northwards,
messages came to me out of Lurien that Aragorn had passed that way, and that
he had found the creature called Gollum. Therefore I went first to meet him
and hear his tale. Into what deadly perils he had gone alone I dared not
guess.’ 'There is little need to tell of them,’ said Aragorn. 'If a man must
needs walk in sight of the Black Gate, or tread the deadly flowers of Morgul
Vale, then perils he will have. I, too, despaired at last, and I began my
homeward journey. And then, by fortune, I came suddenly on what I sought:
the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool. But now the trail was fresh and
swift, and it led not to Mordor but away. Along the skirts of the Dead
Marshes I followed it, and then I had him. Lurking by a stagnant mere,
peering in the water as the dark eve fell, I caught him, Gollum. He was
covered with green slime. He will never love me, I fear; for he bit me, and
I was not gentle. Nothing more did I ever get from his mouth than the marks
of his teeth. I deemed it the worst part of all my journey, the road back,
watching him day and night, making him walk before me with a halter on his
neck, gagged, until he was tamed by lack of drink and food, driving him ever
towards Mirkwood. I brought him there at last and gave him to the Elves, for
we had agreed that this should be done; and I was glad to be rid of his
company, for he stank. For my part I hope never to look upon him again; but
Gandalf came and endured long speech with him.’ 'Yes, long and weary,' said Gandalf, 'but not without profit. For one
thing, the tale he told of his loss agreed with that which Bilbo has now
told openly for the first time; but that mattered little, since I had
already guessed it. But I learned then first that Gollum's ring came out of
the Great River nigh to the Gladden Fields. And I learned also that he had
possessed it long. Many lives of his small kind. The power of the ring had
lengthened his years far beyond their span; but that power only the Great
Rings wield. 'And if that is not proof enough, Galdor, there is the other test that
I spoke of. Upon this very ring which you have here seen held aloft, round
and unadorned, the letters that Isildur reported may still be read, if one
has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a while. That I
have done, and this I have read: Ash nazg durbatulyk, ush nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulyk agh
burzum-ishi krimpatul. ' The change in the wizard's voice was astounding. Suddenly it became
menacing, powerful, harsh as stone. A shadow seemed to pass over the high
sun, and the porch for a moment grew dark. All trembled, and the Elves
stopped their ears. 'Never before has any voice dared to utter the words of that tongue in
Imladris, Gandalf the Grey,’ said Elrond, as the shadow passed and the
company breathed once more. 'And let us hope that none will ever speak it here again,' answered
Gandalf. 'Nonetheless I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond. For if that
tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the West, then let all put
doubt aside that this thing is indeed what the Wise have declared: the
treasure of the Enemy, fraught with all his malice; and in it lies a great
part of his strength of old. Out of the Black Years come the words that the
Smiths of Eregion heard, and knew that they had been betrayed: One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring
them all and in the Darkness bind them. 'Know also, my friends, that I learned more yet from Gollum. He was
loth to speak and his tale was unclear, but it is beyond all doubt that he
went to Mordor, and there all that he knew was forced from him. Thus the
Enemy knows now that the One is found, that it was long in the Shire; and
since his servants have pursued it almost to our door, he soon will know,
already he may know, even as I speak, that we have it here.' All sat silent for a while, until at length Boromir spoke. 'He is a
small thing, you say, this Gollum? Small, but great in mischief. What became
of him? To what doom did you put him?’ 'He is in prison, but no worse,' said Aragorn. 'He had suffered much. There is no doubt that he was tormented, and the fear of Sauron lies black
on his heart. Still I for one am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful
Elves of Mirkwood. His malice is great and gives him a strength hardly to be
believed in one so lean and withered. He could work much mischief still, if
he were free. And I do not doubt that he was allowed to leave Mordor on some
evil errand.' 'Alas! alas!’ cried Legolas, and in his fair elvish face there was
great distress. 'The tidings that I was sent to bring must now be told. They
are not good, but only here have I learned how evil they may seem to this
company. Smjagol, who is now called Gollum, has escaped.’ 'Escaped?' cried Aragorn. 'That is ill news indeed. We shall all rue it
bitterly, I fear. How came the folk of Thranduil to fail in their trust?' 'Not through lack of watchfulness,' said Legolas; 'but perhaps through
over -kindliness. And we fear that the prisoner had aid from others, and that
more is known of our doings than we could wish. We guarded this creature day
and night, at Gandalf s bidding, much though we wearied of the task. But
Gandalf bade us hope still for his cure, and we had not the heart to keep
him ever in dungeons under the earth, where he would fall back into his old
black thoughts.' 'You were less tender to me,' said Gluin with a flash of his eyes as
old memories were stirred of his imprisonment in the deep places of the
Elven-king's halls.
'Now come!' said Gandalf. 'Pray do not interrupt, my good Gluin. That
was a regrettable misunderstanding, long set right. If all the grievances
that stand between Elves and Dwarves are to be brought up here, we may as
well abandon this Council.' Gluin rose and bowed, and Legolas continued. 'In the days of fair
weather we led Gollum through the woods; and there was a high tree standing
alone far from the others which he liked to climb. Often we let him mount up
to the highest branches, until he felt the free wind; but we set a guard at
the tree's foot. One day he refused to come down, and the guards had no mind
to climb after him: he had learned the trick of clinging to boughs with his
feet as well as with his hands; so they sat by the tree far into the night. 'It was that very night of summer, yet moonless and starless, that Ores
came on us at unawares. We drove them off after some time; they were many
and fierce, but they came from over the mountains, and were unused to the
woods. When the battle was over, we found that Gollum was gone, and his
guards were slain or taken. It then seemed plain to us that the attack had
been made for his rescue, and that he knew of it beforehand. How that was
contrived we cannot guess; but Gollum is cunning, and the spies of the Enemy
are many. The dark things that were driven out in the year of the Dragon's
fall have returned in greater numbers, and Mirkwood is again an evil place,
save where our realm is maintained. 'We have failed to recapture Gollum. We came on his trail among those
of many Ores, and it plunged deep into the Forest, going south. But ere long
it escaped our skill, and we dared not continue the hunt; for we were
drawing nigh to Dol Guldur, and that is still a very evil place; we do not
go that way.’ 'Well, well, he is gone,' said Gandalf. 'We have no time to seek for
him again. He must do what he will. But he may play a part yet that neither
he nor Sauron have foreseen. 'And now I will answer Galdor's other questions. What of Saruman? What
are his counsels to us in this need? This tale I must tell in full, for only
Elrond has heard it yet, and that in brief, but it will bear on all that we
must resolve. It is the last chapter in the Tale of the Ring, so far as it
has yet gone. 'At the end of June I was in the Shire, but a cloud of anxiety was on
my mind, and I rode to the southern borders of the little land; for I had a
foreboding of some danger, still hidden from me but drawing near. There
messages reached me telling me of war and defeat in Gondor, and when I heard
of the Black Shadow a chill smote my heart. But I found nothing save a few
fugitives from the South; yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of
which they would not speak. I turned then east and north and journeyed along
the Greenway; and not far from Bree I came upon a traveller sitting on a
bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him. It was Radagast the
Brown, who at one time dwelt at Rhosgobel, near the borders of Mirkwood. He is one of my order, but I had not seen him for many a year. ' "Gandalf ! " he cried. "I was seeking you. But I am a stranger in
these parts. All I knew was that you might be found in a wild region with
the uncouth name of Shire." ' "Your information was correct," I said. "But do not put it that way,
if you meet any of the inhabitants. You are near the borders of the Shire
now. And what do you want with me? It must be pressing. You were never a
traveller, unless driven by great need." ' "I have an urgent errand," he said. "My news is evil." Then he looked
about him, as if the hedges might have ears. "Nazgyl," he whispered. "The
Nine are abroad again. They have crossed the River secretly and are moving
westward. They have taken the guise of riders in black." 'I knew then what I had dreaded without knowing it. " "The enemy must have some great need or purpose," said Radagast; "but
what it is that makes him look to these distant and desolate parts, I cannot
guess." v "What do you mean? " said I. v "I have been told that wherever they go the Riders ask for news of a
land called Shire." ' "The Shire," I said; but my heart sank. For even the Wise might fear
to withstand the Nine, when they are gathered together under their fell
chieftain. A great king and sorcerer he was of old, and now he wields a
deadly fear. "Who told you, and who sent you? " I asked. ' "Saruman the White," answered Radagast. "And he told me to say that
if you feel the need, he will help; but you must seek his aid at once, or it
will be too late." 'And that message brought me hope. For Saruman the White is the
greatest of my order. Radagast is, of course, a worthy Wizard, a master of
shapes and changes of hue; and he has much lore of herbs and beasts, and
birds are especially his friends. But Saruman has long studied the arts of
the Enemy himself, and thus we have often been able to forestall him. It was
by the devices of Saruman that we drove him from Dol Guldur. It might be
that he had found some weapons that would drive back the Nine. ' "I will go to Saruman," I said. ' "Then you must go now," said Radagast; "for I have wasted time in
looking for you, and the days are running short. I was told to find you
before Midsummer, and that is now here. Even if you set out from this spot,
you will hardly reach him before the Nine discover the land that they seek. I myself shall turn back at once." And with that he mounted and would have
ridden straight off. ' "Stay a moment! " I said. "We shall need your help, and the help of
all things that will give it. Send out messages to all the beasts and birds
that are your friends. Tell them to bring news of anything that bears on
this matter to Saruman and Gandalf. Let messages be sent to Orthanc." "I will do that," he said, and rode off as if the Nine were after him. 'I could not follow him then and there. I had ridden very far already
that day, and I was as weary as my horse; and I needed to consider matters. I stayed the night in Bree, and decided that I had no time to return to the
Shire. Never did I make a greater mistake! 'However, I wrote a message to Frodo, and trusted to my friend the
innkeeper to send it to him. I rode away at dawn; and I came at long last to
the dwelling of Saruman. That is far south in Isengard, in the end of the
Misty Mountains, not far from the Gap of Rohan. And Boromir will tell you
that that is a great open vale that lies between the Misty Mountains and the
northmost foothills of Ered Nimrais, the White Mountains of his home. But
Isengard is a circle of sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with a wall,
and in the midst of that valley is a tower of stone called Orthanc. It was
not made by Saruman, but by the Men of N®menor long ago; and it is very tall
and has many secrets; yet it looks not to be a work of craft. It cannot be
reached save by passing the circle of Isengard; and in that circle there is
only one gate. 'Late one evening I came to the gate, like a great arch in the wall of
rock; and it was strongly guarded. But the keepers of the gate were on the
watch for me and told me that Saruman awaited me. I rode under the arch, and
the gate closed silently behind me, and suddenly I was afraid, though I knew
no reason for it. 'But I rode to the foot of Orthanc, and came to the stair of Saruman
and there he met me and led me up to his high chamber. He wore a ring on his
finger. "So you have come, Gandalf," he said to me gravely; but in his eyes
there seemed to be a white light, as if a cold laughter was in his heart. v "Yes, I have come," I said. "I have come for your aid, Saruman the
White." And that title seemed to anger him. ' "Have you indeed, Gandalf the Grey l " he scoffed. "For aid? It has
seldom been heard of that Gandalf the Grey sought for aid, one so cunning
and so wise, wandering about the lands, and concerning himself in every
business, whether it belongs to him or not." 'I looked at him and wondered. "But if I am not deceived," said I, "things are now moving which will require the union of all our strength." ' "That may be so," he said, "but the thought is late in coming to you. How long. I wonder, have you concealed from me, the head of the Council, a
matter of greatest import? What brings you now from your lurking-place in
the Shire? " ' "The Nine have come forth again," I answered. "They have crossed the
River. So Radagast said to me." v "Radagast the Brown! " laughed Saruman, and he no longer concealed
his scorn. "Radagast the Bird-tamer! Radagast the Simple! Radagast the Fool!
Yet he had just the wit to play the part that I set him. For you have come,
and that was all the purpose of my message. And here you will stay, Gandalf
the Grey, and rest from journeys. For I am Saruman the Wise, Saruman
Ring-maker, Saruman of Many Colours! " 'I looked then and saw that his robes, which had seemed white, were not
so, but were woven of all colours, and if he moved they shimmered and
changed hue so that the eye was bewildered. ' "I liked white better," I said. ' "White! " he sneered. "It serves as a beginning. White cloth may be
dyed. The white page can be overwritten; and the white light can be broken." ' "In which case it is no longer white," said I. "And he that breaks a
thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom." ' "You need not speak to me as to one of the fools that you take for
friends," said he. "I have not brought you hither to be instructed by you,
but to give you a choice."
'He drew himself up then and began to declaim, as if he were making a
speech long rehearsed. "The Elder Days are gone. The Middle Days are
passing. The Younger Days are beginning. The time of the Elves is over, but
our time is at hand: the world of Men, which we must rule. But we must have
power, power to order all things as we will, for that good which only the
Wise can see. ' "And listen, Gandalf, my old friend and helper! " he said, coming
near and speaking now in a softer voice. "I said we, for we it may be, if
you will join with me. A new Power is rising. Against it the old allies and
policies will not avail us at all. There is no hope left in Elves or dying
N®menor. This then is one choice before you. before us. We may join with
that Power. It would be wise, Gandalf. There is hope that way. Its victory
is at hand; and there will be rich reward for those that aided it. As the
Power grows, its proved friends will also grow; and the Wise, such as you
and I, may with patience come at last to direct its courses, to control it. We can bide our time, we can keep our thoughts in our hearts, deploring
maybe evils done by the way, but approving the high and ultimate purpose:
Knowledge, Rule, Order; all the things that we have so far striven in vain
to accomplish, hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends.
There need not be, there would not be, any real change in our designs, only
in our means." ' "Saruman," I said, "I have heard speeches of this kind before, but
only in the mouths of emissaries sent from Mordor to deceive the ignorant. I
cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears." 'He looked at me sidelong, and paused a while considering. "Well, I see
that this wise course does not commend itself to you," he said. "Not yet? Not if some better way can be contrived? " 'He came and laid his long hand on my arm. "And why not, Gandalf? " he
whispered. "Why not? The Ruling Ring? If we could command that, then the
Power would pass to us. That is in truth why I brought you here. For I have
many eyes in my service, and I believe that you know where this precious
thing now lies. Is it not so? Or why do the Nine ask for the Shire, and what
is your business there? " As he said this a lust which he could not conceal
shone suddenly in his eyes. ' "Saruman," I said, standing away from him, "only one hand at a time
can wield the One, and you know that well, so do not trouble to say we! But
I would not give it, nay, I would not give even news of it to you, now that
I learn your mind. You were head of the Council, but you have unmasked
yourself at last. Well, the choices are, it seems, to submit to Sauron, or
to yourself. I will take neither. Have you others to offer? " ’He was cold now and perilous. "Yes," he said. "I did not expect you to
show wisdom, even in your own behalf; but I gave you the chance of aiding me
willingly, and so saving yourself much trouble and pain. The third choice is
to stay here, until the end." ' "Until what end? " ' "Until you reveal to me where the One may be found. I may find means
to persuade you. Or until it is found in your despite, and the Ruler has
time to turn to lighter matters: to devise, say, a fitting reward for the
hindrance and insolence of Gandalf the Grey." ' "That may not prove to be one of the lighter matters," said I. He
laughed at me, for my words were empty, and he knew it. 'They took me and they set me alone on the pinnacle of Orthanc, in the
place where Saruman was accustomed to watch the stars. There is no descent
save by a narrow stair of many thousand steps, and the valley below seems
far away. I looked on it and saw that, whereas it had once been green and
fair, it was now filled with pits and forges. Wolves and ores were housed in
Isengard, for Saruman was mustering a great force on his own account, in
rivalry of Sauron and not in his service yet. Over all his works a dark
smoke hung and wrapped itself about the sides of Orthanc. I stood alone on
an island in the clouds; and I had no chance of escape, and my days were
bitter. I was pierced with cold, and I had but little room in which to pace
to and fro, brooding on the coming of the Riders to the North. 'That the Nine had indeed arisen I felt assured, apart from the words
of Saruman which might be lies. Long ere I came to Isengard I had heard
tidings by the way that could not be mistaken. Fear was ever in my heart for
my friends in the Shire; but still I had some hope. I hoped that Frodo had
set forth at once, as my letter had urged, and that he had reached Rivendell
before the deadly pursuit began. And both my fear and my hope proved
ill-founded. For my hope was founded on a fat man in Bree; and my fear was
founded on the cunning of Sauron. But fat men who sell ale have many calls
to answer; and the power of Sauron is still less than fear makes it. But in
the circle of Isengard, trapped and alone, it was not easy to think that the
hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the Shire far
away.’
'I saw you!' cried Frodo. 'You were walking backwards and forwards. The
moon shone in your hair.' Gandalf paused astonished and looked at him. 'It was only a dream' said
Frodo, 'but it suddenly came back to me. I had quite forgotten it. It came
some time ago; after I left the Shire, I think.' 'Then it was late in coming,' said Gandalf, 'as you will see. I was in
an evil plight. And those who know me will agree that I have seldom been in
such need, and do not bear such misfortune well. Gandalf the Grey caught
like a fly in a spider's treacherous web! Yet even the most subtle spiders
may leave a weak thread. 'At first I feared, as Saruman no doubt intended, that Radagast had
also fallen. Yet I had caught no hint of anything wrong in his voice or in
his eye at our meeting. If I had, I should never have gone to Isengard, or I
should have gone more warily. So Saruman guessed, and he had concealed his
mind and deceived his messenger. It would have been useless in any case to
try and win over the honest Radagast to treachery. He sought me in good
faith, and so persuaded me. 'That was the undoing of Saruman's plot. For Radagast knew no reason
why he should not do as I asked; and he rode away towards Mirkwood where
he had many friends of old. And the Eagles of the Mountains went far and wide,
and they saw many things: the gathering of wolves and the mustering of Ores;
and the Nine Riders going hither and thither in the lands; and they heard
news of the escape of Gollum. And they sent a messenger to bring these
tidings to me. 'So it was that when summer waned, there came a night of moon, and
Gwaihir the Windlord, swiftest of the Great Eagles, came unlooked-for to
Orthanc; and he found me standing on the pinnacle. Then I spoke to him and
he bore me away, before Saruman was aware. I was far from Isengard, ere the
wolves and ores issued from the gate to pursue me. ' "How far can you bear me? " I said to Gwaihir. ' "Many leagues," said he, "but not to the ends of the earth. I was
sent to bear tidings not burdens." ' "Then I must have a steed on land," I said, "and a steed surpassingly
swift, for I have never had such need of haste before." ' "Then I will bear you to Edoras, where the Lord of Rohan sits in his
halls," he said; "for that is not very far off." And I was glad, for in the
Riddermark of Rohan the Rohirrim, the Horse-lords, dwell, and there are no
horses like those that are bred in that great vale between the Misty
Mountains and the White. ' "Are the Men of Rohan still to be trusted, do you think? " I said to
Gwaihir, for the treason of Saruman had shaken my faith. ' "They pay a tribute of horses," he answered, "and send many yearly to
Mordor, or so it is said; but they are not yet under the yoke. But if
Saruman has become evil, as you say, then their doom cannot be long
delayed." 'He set me down in the land of Rohan ere dawn; and now I have
lengthened my tale over long. The rest must be more brief. In Rohan I found
evil already at work: the lies of Saruman; and the king of the land would
not listen to my warnings. He bade me take a horse and be gone; and I chose
one much to my liking, but little to his. I took the best horse in his land,
and I have never seen the like of him.’ ’Then he must be a noble beast indeed,’ said Aragorn; 'and it grieves
me more than many tidings that might seem worse to learn that Sauron levies
such tribute. It was not so when last I was in that land.’ 'Nor is it now, I will swear,’ said Boromir. 'It is a lie that comes
from the Enemy. I know the Men of Rohan; true and valiant, our allies,
dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago.’ 'The shadow of Mordor lies on distant lands,’ answered Aragorn.
’Saruman has fallen under it. Rohan is beset. Who knows what you will find
there, if ever you return?’ 'Not this at least.’ said Boromir, ’that they will buy their lives with
horses. They love their horses next to their kin. And not without reason,
for the horses of the Riddermark come from the fields of the North, far from
the Shadow, and their race, as that of their masters, is descended from the
free days of old.’ ’True indeed!’ said Gandalf. 'And there is one among them that might
have been foaled in the morning of the world. The horses of the Nine cannot
vie with him; tireless, swift as the flowing wind. Shadowfax they called
him. By day his coat glistens like silver; and by night it is like a shade,
and he passes unseen. Light is his footfall! Never before had any man
mounted him, but I took him and I tamed him, and so speedily he bore me that
I reached the Shire when Frodo was on the Barrow-downs, though I set out
from Rohan only when he set out from Hobbiton.
'But fear grew in me as I rode. Ever as I came north I heard tidings of
the Riders, and though I gained on them day by day, they were ever before
me. They had divided their forces, I learned: some remained on the eastern
borders, not far from the Greenway. and some invaded the Shire from the
south. I came to Hobbiton and Frodo had gone; but I had words with old
Gamgee. Many words and few to the point. He had much to say about the
shortcomings of the new owners of Bag End. ' "I can't abide changes," said he, "not at my time of life, and least
of all changes for the worst." "Changes for the worst," he repeated many
times. ' "Worst is a bad word," I said to him, "and I hope you do not live to
see it." But amidst his talk I gathered at last that Frodo had left Hobbiton
less than a week before, and that a black horseman had come to the Hill the
same evening. Then I rode on in fear. I came to Buckland and found it in
uproar, as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick. I came
to the house at Crickhollow, and it was broken open and empty; but on the
threshold there lay a cloak that had been Frodo's. Then for a while hope
left me, and I did not wait to gather news, or I might have been comforted;
but I rode on the trail of the Riders. It was hard to follow, for it went
many ways, and I was at a loss. But it seemed to me that one or two had
ridden towards Bree; and that way I went, for I thought of words that might
be said to the innkeeper. ' "Butterbur they call him," thought I. "If this delay was his fault, I
will melt all the butter in him. I will roast the old fool over a slow
fire." He expected no less, and when he saw my face he fell down flat and
began to melt on the spot.' 'What did you do to him?' cried Frodo in alarm. 'He was really very
kind to us and did all that he could.' Gandalf laughed. 'Don't be afraid!' he said. 'I did not bite, and I
barked very little. So overjoyed was I by the news that I got out of him,
when he stopped quaking, that I embraced the old fellow. How it happened I
could not then guess, but I learned that you had been in Bree the night
before, and had gone off that morning with Strider. ' "Strider! " I cried, shouting for joy. "Yes, sir, I am afraid so, sir," said Butterbur, mistaking me. "He
got at them, in spite of all that I could do, and they took up with him. They behaved very queer all the time they were here: wilful, you might say."
"Ass! Fool! Thrice worthy and beloved Barliman! " said I. "It's the
best news I have had since midsummer: it's worth a gold piece at the least.
May your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing excellence for
seven years! " said I. "Now I can take a night's rest, the first since I
have forgotten when." 'Sol stayed there that night, wondering much what had become of the
Riders; for only of two had there yet been any news in Bree, it seemed. But
in the night we heard more. Five at least came from the west, and they threw
down the gates and passed through Bree like a howling wind; and the
Bree-folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world. I got up
before dawn and went after them. 'I do not know, but it seems clear to me that this is what happened. Their Captain remained in secret away south of Bree, while two rode ahead
through the village, and four more invaded the Shire. But when these were
foiled in Bree and at Crickhollow, they returned to their Captain with
tidings, and so left the Road unguarded for a while, except by their spies. The Captain then sent some eastward straight across country, and he himself
with the rest rode along the Road in great wrath. 'I galloped to Weathertop like a gale, and I reached it before sundown
on my second day from Bree-and they were there before me. They drew
away from me, for they felt the coming of my anger and they dared not face it
while the Sun was in the sky. But they closed round at night, and I was
besieged on the hill -top, in the old ring of Amon Syl. I was hard put to it
indeed: such light and flame cannot have been seen on Weathertop since the
war-beacons of old. 'At sunrise I escaped and fled towards the north. I could not hope to
do more. It was impossible to find you, Frodo, in the wilderness, and it
would have been folly to try with all the Nine at my heels. Sol had to
trust to Aragorn. But I hoped to draw some of them off, and yet reach
Rivendell ahead of you and send out help. Four Riders did indeed follow me,
but they turned back after a while and made for the Ford, it seems. That
helped a little, for there were only five, not nine, when your camp was
attacked. ’I reached here at last by a long hard road, up the Floarwell and
through the Ettenmoors, and down from the north. It took me nearly fourteen
days from Weathertop, for I could not ride among the rocks of the
troll-fells, and Shadowfax departed. I sent him back to his master; but a
great friendship has grown between us, and if I have need he will come at my
call. But so it was that I came to Rivendell only three days before the
Ring, and news of its peril had already been brought here-which proved well
indeed. 'And that, Frodo, is the end of my account. May Elrond and the others
forgive the length of it. But such a thing has not happened before, that
Gandalf broke tryst and did not come when he promised. An account to the
Ring-bearer of so strange an event was required, I think. 'Well, the Tale is now told, from first to last. Here we all are, and
here is the Ring. But we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose. What
shall we do with it?' There was silence. At last Elrond spoke again. 'This is grievous news concerning Saruman,' he said; 'for we trusted
him and he is deep in all our counsels. It is perilous to study too deeply
the arts of the Enemy, for good or for ill. But such falls and betrayals,
alas, have happened before. Of the tales that we have heard this day the
tale of Frodo was most strange to me. I have known few hobbits, save Bilbo
here; and it seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone and singular as I
had thought him. The world has changed much since I last was on the
westward
roads. 'The Barrow- wights we know by many names; and of the Old Forest
many tales have been told: all that now remains is but an outlier of its northern
march. Time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now
the Shire to Dunland west of Isengard. In those lands I journeyed once, and
many things wild and strange I knew. But I had forgotten Bombadil, if indeed
this is still the same that walked the woods and hills long ago, and even
then was older than the old. That was not then his name. Iarwain Ben-adar we
called him, oldest and fatherless. But many another name he has since been
given by other folk: Forn by the Dwarves, Orald by Northern Men, and other
names beside. He is a strange creature, but maybe I should have summoned
him to our Council.' 'He would not have come,' said Gandalf. 'Could we not still send messages to him and obtain his help?’ asked
Erestor. 'It seems that he has a power even over the Ring.' 'No, I should not put it so,’ said Gandalf. 'Say rather that the Ring
has no power over him. He is his own master. But he cannot alter the Ring
itself, nor break its power over others. And now he is withdrawn into a
little land, within bounds that he has set, though none can see them,
waiting perhaps for a change of days, and he will not step beyond them.' 'But within those bounds nothing seems to dismay him,' said Erestor.
'Would he not take the Ring and keep it there, for ever harmless?’ 'No,’ said Gandalf, 'not willingly. He might do so, if all the free
folk of the world begged him, but he would not understand the need. And if
he were given the Ring, he would soon forget it, or most likely throw it
away. Such things have no hold on his mind. He would be a most unsafe
guardian; and that alone is answer enough.’ 'But in any case,’ said Glorfindel, 'to send the Ring to him would only
postpone the day of evil. He is far away. We could not now take it back to
him, unguessed, unmarked by any spy. And even if we could, soon or late the
Lord of the Rings would learn of its hiding place and would bend all his
power towards it. Could that power be defied by Bombadil alone? I think not. I think that in the end, if all else is conquered, Bombadil will fall, Last
as he was First; and then Night will come.’ 'I know little of Iarwain save the name,’ said Galdor; 'but Glorfindel, I think, is right. Power to defy our Enemy is not in him, unless such power
is in the earth itself. And yet we see that Sauron can torture and destroy
the very hills. What power still remains lies with us, here in Imladris, or
with Cirdan at the Havens, or in Lurien. But have they the strength, have we
here the strength to withstand the Enemy, the coming of Sauron at the last,
when all else is overthrown?’ 'I have not the strength,’ said Elrond; 'neither have they.’ 'Then if the Ring cannot be kept from him for ever by strength’ said
Glorfindel, 'two things only remain for us to attempt: to send it over the
Sea, or to destroy it.’ 'But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft
that we here possess,’ said Elrond. 'And they who dwell beyond the Sea would
not receive it: for good or ill it belongs to Middle-earth; it is for us who
still dwell here to deal with it.’ ’Then, said Glorfindel, ’let us cast it into the deeps, and so make the
lies of Saruman come true. For it is clear now that even at the Council his
feet were already on a crooked path. He knew that the Ring was not lost for
ever, but wished us to think so; for he began to lust for it for himself. Yet oft in lies truth is hidden: in the Sea it would be safe.' 'Not safe for ever,' said Gandalf. 'There are many things in the deep
waters; and seas and lands may change. And it is not our part here to take
thought only for a season, or for a few lives of Men, or for a passing age
of the world. We should seek a final end of this menace, even if we do not
hope to make one.’ 'And that we shall not find on the roads to the Sea,' said Galdor. 'If
the return to Iarwain be thought too dangerous, then flight to the S,a is
now fraught with gravest peril. My heart tells me that Sauron will expect us
to take the western way, when he learns what has befallen. He soon will. The
Nine have been unhorsed indeed but that is but a respite, ere they find new
steeds and swifter. Only the waning might of Gondor stands now between him
and a march in power along the coasts into the North; and if he comes,
assailing the White Towers and the Havens, hereafter the Elves may have no
escape from the lengthening shadows of Middle-earth.' 'Long yet will that march be delayed,' said Boromir. 'Gondor wanes, you
say. But Gondor stands, and even the end of its strength is still very
strong.' 'And yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the Nine,' said Galdor. 'And other roads he may find that Gondor does not guard.' 'Then,' said Erestor, 'there are but two courses, as Glorfindel already
has declared: to hide the Ring for ever; or to unmake it. But both are
beyond our power. Who will read this riddle for us?’ 'None here can do so,' said Elrond gravely. 'At least none can foretell
what will come to pass, if we take this road or that. But it seems to me now
clear which is the road that we must take. The westward road seems easiest.
Therefore it must be shunned. It will be watched. Too often the Elves have
fled that way. Now at this last we must take a hard road, a road unforeseen.
There lies our hope, if hope it be. To walk into peril-to Mordor. We must
send the Ring to the Fire.’ Silence fell again. Frodo, even in that fair house, looking out upon a
sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters, felt a dead darkness in
his heart. Boromir stirred, and Frodo looked at him. He was fingering his
great horn and frowning. At length he spoke. ’I do not understand all this,' he said. 'Saruman is a traitor, but did
he not have a glimpse of wisdom? Why do you speak ever of hiding and
destroying? Why should we not think that the Great Ring has come into our
hands to serve us in the very hour of need? Wielding it the Free Lords of
the Free may surely defeat the Enemy. That is what he most fears, I deem. The Men of Gondor are valiant, and they will never submit; but they
may be beaten down. Valour needs first strength, and then a weapon. Let the
Ring be your weapon, if it has such power as you say. Take it and go forth
to victory!' ’Alas, no,’ said Elrond. ’We cannot use the Ruling Ring. That we now
know too well. It belongs to Sauron and was made by him alone, and is
altogether evil. Its strength, Boromir, is too great for anyone to wield at
will, save only those who have already a great power of their own. But for
them it holds an even deadlier peril. The very desire of it corrupts the
heart. Consider Saruman. If any of the Wise should with this Ring overthrow
the Lord of Mordor, using his own arts, he would then set himself on
Sauron’s throne, and yet another Dark Lord would appear. And that is another
reason why the Ring should be destroyed: as long as it is in the world it
will be a danger even to the Wise. For nothing is evil in the beginning.
Even Sauron was not so. I fear to take the Ring to hide it. I will not take
the Ring to wield it.' 'Nor I,' said Gandalf. Boromir looked at them doubtfully, but he bowed his head. 'So be it,’
he said. 'Then in Gondor we must trust to such weapons as we have. And at
the least, while the Wise ones guard this Ring, we will fight on. Mayhap the
Sword-that-was-Broken may still stem the tide — if the hand that wields it
has inherited not an heirloom only, but the sinews of the Kings of Men.’ 'Who can tell?’ said Aragorn. 'But we will put it to the test one day.’ 'May the day not be too long delayed,' said Boromir. 'For though I do
not ask for aid, we need it. It would comfort us to know that others fought
also with all the means that they have.' 'Then be comforted,’ said Elrond. 'For there are other powers and
realms that you know not, and they are hidden from you. Anduin the Great
flows past many shores, ere it comes to Argonath and the Gates of Gondor.' 'Still it might be well for all,' said Gluin the Dwarf, 'if all these
strengths were joined, and the powers of each were used in league. Other
rings there may be, less treacherous, that might be used in our need. The
Seven are lost to us — if Balin has not found the ring of Thrur which was
the last; naught has been heard of it since Thrur perished in Moria. Indeed
I may now reveal that it was partly in hope to find that ring that Balin
went away.’ 'Balin will find no ring in Moria,' said Gandalf. 'Thrur gave it to
Thrbin his son, but not Thrbin to Thorin. It was taken with torment from
Thrbin in the dungeons of Dol Guldur. I came too late.' 'Ah, alas!' cried Gluin. 'When will the day come of our revenge? But
still there are the Three. What of the Three Rings of the Elves? Very mighty
Rings, it is said. Do not the Elf-lords keep them? Yet they too were made by
the Dark Lord long ago. Are they idle? I see Elf-lords here. Will they not
say?' The Elves returned no answer. 'Did you not hear me, Gluin?’ said
Elrond. 'The Three were not made by Sauron, nor did he ever touch them. But
of them it is not permitted to speak. So much only in this' hour of doubt I
may now say. They are not idle. But they were not made as weapons of war or
conquest: that is not their power. Those who made them did not desire
strength or domination or hoarded wealth, but understanding, making, and
healing, to preserve all things unstained. These things the Elves of
Middle-earth have in some measure gained, though with sorrow. But all that
has been wrought by those who wield the Three will turn to their undoing,
and their minds and hearts will become revealed to Sauron, if he regains the
One. It would be better if the Three had never been. That is his purpose.' 'But what then would happen, if the Ruling Ring were destroyed as you
counsel?’ asked Gluin. 'We know not for certain,' answered Elrond sadly. 'Some hope that the
Three Rings, which Sauron has never touched, would then become free, and
their rulers might heal the hurts of the world that he has wrought. But
maybe when the One has gone, the Three will fail, and many fair things will
fade and be forgotten. That is my belief.' 'Yet all the Elves are willing to endure this chance,' said Glorfindel
'if by it the power of Sauron may be broken, and the fear of his dominion be
taken away for ever.' 'Thus we return once more to the destroying of the Ring,' said Erestor, 'and yet we come no nearer. What strength have we for the finding of the
Fire in which it was made? That is the path of despair. Of folly I would
say, if the long wisdom of Elrond did not forbid me.' 'Despair, or folly?' said Gandalf. 'It is not despair, for despair is
only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not. It is wisdom to
recognize necessity, when all other courses have been weighed, though as
folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope. Well, let folly be our
cloak, a veil before the eyes of the Enemy! For he is very wise, and weighs
all things to a nicety in the scales of his malice. But the only measure
that he knows is desire, desire for power; and so he judges all hearts. Into
his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it, that having
the Ring we may seek to destroy it. If we seek this, we shall put him out of
reckoning.' 'At least for a while,' said Elrond. 'The road must be trod, but it
will be very hard. And neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon
it. This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong.
Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small
hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.' 'Very well, very well, Master Elrond!' said Bilbo suddenly. 'Say no
more! It is plain enough what you are pointing at. Bilbo the silly hobbit
started this affair, and Bilbo had better finish it, or himself. I was very
comfortable here, and getting on with my book. If you want to know, I am
just writing an ending for it. I had thought of putting: and he lived
happily ever afterwards to the end of his days. It is a good ending, and
none the worse for having been used before. Now I shall have to alter that:
it does not look like coming true; and anyway there will evidently have to
be several more chapters, if I live to write them. It is a frightful
nuisance. When ought I to start? ' Boromir looked in surprise at Bilbo, but the laughter died on his
lips when he saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave
respect. Only Gluin smiled, but his smile came from old memories. 'Of course, my dear Bilbo,’ said Gandalf. 'If you had really started
this affair, you might be expected to finish it. But you know well enough
now that starting is too great a claim for any, and that only a small part
is played in great deeds by any hero. You need not bow! Though the word was
meant, and we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer. But one beyond your strength, Bilbo. You cannot take this thing back. It has
passed on. If you need my advice any longer, I should say that your part is
ended, unless as a recorder. Finish your book, and leave the ending
unaltered! There is still hope for it. But get ready to write a sequel, when
they come back.'
Bilbo laughed. 'I have never known you give me pleasant advice before.'
he said. 'As all your unpleasant advice has been good, I wonder if this
advice is not bad. Still, I don't suppose I have the strength or luck left
to deal with the Ring. It has grown, and I have not. But tell me: what do
you mean by they? 'The messengers who are sent with the Ring.’ 'Exactly! And who are they to be? That seems to me what this Council
has to decide, and all that it has to decide. Elves may thrive on speech
alone, and Dwarves endure great weariness; but I am only an old hobbit, and
I miss my meal at noon. Can't you think of some names now? Or put it off
till after dinner?' No one answered. The noon-bell rang. Still no one spoke. Frodo glanced
at all the faces, but they were not turned to him. All the Council sat with
downcast eyes, as if in deep thought. A great dread fell on him, as if he
was awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had long foreseen and
vainly hoped might after all never be spoken. An overwhelming longing to
rest and remain at peace by Bilbo's side in Rivendell filled all his heart. At last with an effort he spoke, and wondered to hear his own words, as if
some other will was using his small voice. 'I will take the Ring,' he said, 'though I do not know the way.' Elrond raised his eyes and looked at him, and Frodo felt his heart
pierced by the sudden keenness of the glance. 'If I understand aright all
that I have heard,' he said, 'I think that this task is appointed for you, Frodo; and that if you do not find a way, no one will. This is the hour of
the Shire-folk, when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers
and counsels of the Great. Who of all the Wise could have foreseen it? Or,
if they are wise, why should they expect to know it, until the hour has
struck? 'But it is a heavy burden. So heavy that none could lay it on another. I do not lay it on you. But if you take it freely, I will say that your
choice is right; and though all the mighty elf-friends of old, Hador, and
H®rin, and T®rin, and Beren himself were assembled together your seat
should be among them.' 'But you won't send him off alone surely, Master?' cried Sam, unable to
contain himself any longer, and jumping up from the corner where he had been
quietly sitting on the floor.
'No indeed!' said Elrond, turning towards him with a smile. 'You at
least shall go with him. It is hardly possible to separate you from him,
even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.' Sam sat down, blushing and muttering. 'A nice pickle we have landed
ourselves in, Mr. Frodo!’ he said, shaking his head.
Chapter 3 . The Ring Goes South Later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in Bilbo's room.
Merry and Pippin were indignant when they heard that Sam had crept into the
Council, and had been chosen as Frodo's companion. 'It's most unfair,' said Pippin. 'Instead of throwing him out, and
clapping him in chains, Elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek!' 'Rewards!' said Frodo. 'I can't imagine a more severe punishment. You
are not thinking what you are saying: condemned to go on this hopeless
journey, a reward? Yesterday I dreamed that my task was done, and I could
rest here, a long while, perhaps for good.' 'I don't wonder,' said Merry, 'and I wish you could. But we are envying
Sam, not you. If you have to go, then it will be a punishment for any of us
to be left behind, even in Rivendell. We have come a long way with you and
been through some stiff times. We want to go on.' 'That's what I meant,' said Pippin. 'We hobbits ought to stick
together, and we will. I shall go, unless they chain me up. There must be
someone with intelligence in the party.' 'Then you certainly will not be chosen, Peregrin Took!' said Gandalf,
looking in through the window, which was near the ground. 'But you are all
worrying yourselves unnecessarily. Nothing is decided yet.' 'Nothing decided!’ cried Pippin. ’Then what were you all doing? You
were shut up for hours.' "Talking,' said Bilbo. 'There was a deal of talk, and everyone had an
eye-opener. Even old Gandalf. I think Legolas's bit of news about Gollum
caught even him on the hop, though he passed it off.' 'You were wrong,' said Gandalf. 'You were inattentive. I had already
heard of it from Gwaihir. If you want to know, the only real eye-openers, as
you put it, were you and Frodo; and I was the only one that was not
surprised.' 'Well, anyway,' said Bilbo, 'nothing was decided beyond choosing poor
Frodo and Sam. I was afraid all the time that it might come to that, if I
was let off. But if you ask me, Elrond will send out a fair number, when the
reports come in. Have they started yet, Gandalf?' 'Yes,' said the wizard. 'Some of the scouts have been sent out already.
More will go tomorrow. Elrond is sending Elves, and they will get in touch
with the Rangers, and maybe with Thranduil's folk in Mirkwood. And
Aragorn has gone with Elrond's sons. We shall have to scour the lands all round for
many long leagues before any move is made. So cheer up, Frodo! You will
probably make quite along stay here.' 'Ah!' said Sam gloomily. 'We'll just wait long enough for winter to
come.' 'That can't be helped,' said Bilbo. 'It's your fault partly, Frodo my
lad: insisting on waiting for my birthday. A funny way of honouring it, I
can't help thinking. Not the day I should have chosen for letting the S.-B.s
into Bag End. But there it is: you can't wait now fill spring; and you can't
go till the reports come back. When winter first begins to bite
and stones crack in the frosty night,
when pools are black and trees are bare, 'tis evil in the Wild to fare. But that I am afraid will be just your luck.' 'I am afraid it will,' said Gandalf. 'We can't start until we have
found out about the Riders.' T thought they were all destroyed in the flood,' said Merry. 'You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,' said Gandalf. 'The power of
their master is in them, and they stand or fall by him. We hope that they
were all unhorsed and unmasked, and so made for a while less dangerous; but
we must find out for certain. In the meantime you should try and forget your
troubles, Frodo. I do not know if I can do anything to help you; but I will
whisper this in your ears. Someone said that intelligence would be needed in
the party. He was right. I think I shall come with you.' So great was Frodo's delight at this announcement that Gandalf left the
window-sill, where he had been sitting, and took off his hat and bowed. 'I
only said I think I shall come. Do not count on anything yet. In this matter
Elrond will have much to say, and your friend the Strider. Which reminds me,
I want to see Elrond. I must be off.' 'How long do you think I shall have here?’ said Frodo to Bilbo when
Gandalf had gone. 'Oh, I don't know. I can't count days in Rivendell,' said Bilbo. 'But
quite long, I should think. We can have many a good talk. What about helping
me with my book, and making a start on the next? Have you thought of an
ending?' 'Yes, several, and all are dark and unpleasant,' said Frodo. 'Oh, that won't do!' said Bilbo. 'Books ought to have good endings. How
would this do: and they all settled down and lived together happily ever
after?' 'It will do well, if it ever comes to that,' said Frodo. 'Ah!' said Sam. 'And where will they live? That's what I often wonder.' For a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey
and of the perils that lay ahead; but such was the virtue of the land of
Rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds. The
future, good or ill, was not forgotten, but ceased to have any power over
the present. Health and hope grew strong in them, and they were content with
each good day as it came, taking pleasure in every meal, and in every word
and song. So the days slipped away, as each morning dawned bright and fair, and
each evening followed cool and clear. But autumn was waning fast; slowly the
golden light faded to pale silver, and the lingering leaves fell from the
naked trees. A wind began to blow chill from the Misty Mountains to the
east. The Hunter's Moon waxed round in the night sky, and put to flight all
the lesser stars. But low in the South one star shone red. Every night, as
the Moon waned again, it shone brighter and brighter. Frodo could see it
from his window, deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared
above the trees on the brink of the valley. The hobbits had been nearly two months in the House of Elrond, and
November had gone by with the last shreds of autumn, and December was
passing, when the scouts began to return. Some had gone north beyond the
springs of the Hoarwell into the Ettenmoors; and others had gone west, and
with the help of Aragorn and the Rangers had searched the lands far down the
Greyflood, as far as Tharbad, where the old North Road crossed the river by
a ruined town. Many had gone east and south; and some of these had crossed
the Mountains and entered Mirkwood, while others had climbed the pass at the
source of the Gladden River, and had come down into Wilderland and over the
Gladden Fields and so at length had reached the old home of Radagast at
Rhosgobel. Radagast was not there; and they had returned over the high pass
that was called the Dimrill Stair. The sons of Elrond, Elladan and Elrohir,
were the last to return; they had made a great journey, passing down the
Silverlode into a strange country, but of their errand they would not speak
to any save to Elrond. In no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the
Riders or other servants of the Enemy. Even from the Eagles of the Misty
Mountains they had learned no fresh news. Nothing had been seen or heard of
Gollum; but the wild wolves were still gathering, and were hunting again far
up the Great River. Three of the black horses had been found at once drowned
in the flooded Ford. On the rocks of the rapids below it searchers
discovered the bodies of five more, and also a long black cloak, slashed and
tattered. Of the Black Riders no other trace was to be seen, and nowhere was
their presence to be felt. It seemed that they had vanished from the North. ’Eight out of the Nine are accounted for at least,' said Gandalf. 'It
is rash to be too sure, yet I think that we may hope now that the
Ringwraiths were scattered, and have been obliged to return as best they
could to their Master in Mordor, empty and shapeless. Tf that is so, it will be some time before they can begin the hunt
again. Of course the Enemy has other servants, but they will have to journey
all the way to the borders of Rivendell before they can pick up our trail. And if we are careful that will be hard to find. But we must delay no
longer.' Elrond summoned the hobbits to him. He looked gravely at Frodo. 'The
time has come,' he said. 'If the Ring is to set out, it must go soon. But
those who go with it must not count on their errand being aided by war or
force. They must pass into the domain of the Enemy far from aid. Do you
still hold to your word, Frodo, that you will be the Ring-bearer?' 'I do,' said Frodo. 'I will go with Sam.' 'Then I cannot help you much, not even with counsel,' said Elrond. 'I
can foresee very little of your road; and how your task is to be achieved I
do not know. The Shadow has crept now to the feet of the Mountains, and
draws nigh even to the borders of Greyflood; and under the Shadow all is
dark to me. You will meet many foes, some open, and some disguised; and
you may find friends upon your way when you least look for it. I will send out
messages, such as I can contrive, to those whom I know in the wide world;
but so perilous are the lands now become that some may well miscarry, or
come no quicker than you yourself. 'And I will choose you companions to go with you, as far as they will
or fortune allows. The number must be few, since your hope is in speed and
secrecy. Had I a host of Elves in armour of the Elder Days, it would avail
little, save to arouse the power of Mordor. 'The Company of the Ring shall be Nine; and the Nine Walkers shall be
set against the Nine Riders that are evil. With you and your faithful
servant, Gandalf will go; for this shall be his great task, and maybe the
end of his labours. 'For the rest, they shall represent the other Free Peoples of the
World: Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Legolas shall be for the Elves; and Gimli
son of Gluin for the Dwarves. They are willing to go at least to the passes
of the Mountains, and maybe beyond. For men you shall have Aragorn son of
Arathorn, for the Ring of Isildur concerns him closely.' 'Strider!' said Frodo. ’Yes,' he said with a smile. 'I ask leave once again to be your
companion, Frodo.' 'I would have begged you to come,’ said Frodo, 'only I thought you were
going to Minas Tirith with Boromir.' 'I am,' said Aragorn. 'And the Sword-that-was-Broken shall be reforged
ere I set out to war. But your road and our road lie together for many
hundreds of miles. Therefore Boromir will also be in the Company. He is a
valiant man.’ ’There remain two more to be found,' said Elrond. "These I will
consider. Of my household I may find some that it seems good to me to send.' 'But that will leave no place for us!' cried Pippin in dismay. 'We
don't want to be left behind. We want to go with Frodo.' 'That is because you do not understand and cannot imagine what lies
ahead,' said Elrond. 'Neither does Frodo,' said Gandalf, unexpectedly supporting Pippin. 'Nor do any of us see clearly. It is true that if these hobbits understood
the danger, they would not dare to go. But they would still wish to go, or
wish that they dared, and be shamed and unhappy. I think, Elrond, that in
this matter it would be well to trust rather to their friendship than to
great wisdom. Even if you chose for us an elf-lord, such as Glorfindel, he
could not storm the Dark Tower, nor open the road to the Fire by the power
that is in him.' 'You speak gravely,' said Elrond, 'but I am in doubt. The Shire, I
forebode, is not free now from peril; and these two I had thought to send
back there as messengers, to do what they could, according to the fashion of
their country, to warn the people of their danger. In any case, I judge that
the younger of these two, Peregrin Took, should remain. My heart is against
his going.' 'Then, Master Elrond, you will have to lock me in prison, or send me
home tied in a sack,' said Pippin. 'For otherwise I shall follow the
Company.’ 'Let it be so then. You shall go,’ said Elrond, and he sighed. 'Now the
tale of Nine is filled. In seven days the Company must depart.' The Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths, and on its blade
was traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent Moon and the
rayed Sun, and about them was written many runes; for Aragorn son of
Arathorn was going to war upon the marches of Mordor. Very bright was that
sword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it,
and the light of the moon shone cold, and its edge was hard and keen. And
Aragorn gave it a new name and called it And®ril, Flame of the West. Aragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and
the perils they would meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps
and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond. Sometimes Frodo was with
them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much
time as he could with Bilbo. In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall
of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren
and L®thien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry
and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in
his own small room. Then Bilbo would read passages from his book (which
still seemed very incomplete), or scraps of his verses, or would take notes
of Frodo's adventures. On the morning of the last day Frodo was alone with Bilbo, and the old
hobbit pulled out from under his bed a wooden box. He lifted the lid and
fumbled inside. 'Here is your sword,' he said. 'But it was broken, you know. I took it
to keep it safe but I've forgotten to ask if the smiths could mend it. No
time now.. So I thought, perhaps, you would care to have this, don't you
know?' He took from the box a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard.
Then he drew it, and its polished and well-tended blade glittered suddenly,
cold and bright. This is Sting,' he said, and thrust it with little effort
deep into a wooden beam. 'Take it, if you like. I shan’t want it again, I
expect.' Frodo accepted it gratefully. 'Also there is this!' said Bilbo, bringing out a parcel which seemed to
be rather heavy for its size. He unwound several folds of old cloth, and
held up a small shirt of mail. It was close-woven of many rings, as supple
almost as linen, cold as ice, and harder than steel. It shone like moonlit
silver, and was studded with white gems. With it was a belt of pearl and
crystal. 'It's a pretty thing, isn't it?' said Bilbo, moving it in the light. 'And useful. It is my dwarf-mail that Thorin gave me. I got it back from
Michel Delving before I started, and packed it with my luggage: I brought
all the mementoes of my Journey away with me, except the Ring. But I did not
expect to use this, and I don't need it now, except to look at sometimes. You hardly feel any weight when you put it on.' 'I should look — well, I don't think I should look right in it,' said
Frodo. 'Just what I said myself,’ said Bilbo. 'But never mind about looks. You
can wear it under your outer clothes. Come on! You must share this secret
with me. Don't tell anybody else! But I should feel happier if I knew you
were wearing it. I have a fancy it would turn even the knives of the Black
Riders,' he ended in a low voice. 'Very well, I will take it,' said Frodo. Bilbo put it on him, and
fastened Sting upon the glittering belt; and then Frodo put over the top his
old weather-stained breeches, tunic, and jacket. 'Just a plain hobbit you look,' said Bilbo. 'But there is more about
you now than appears on the surface. Good luck to you!' He turned away and
looked out of the window, trying to hum a tune. 'I cannot thank you as I should, Bilbo, for this, and for all our past
kindnesses,' said Frodo. 'Don't try!' said the old hobbit, turning round and slapping him on the
back. 'Ow!' he cried. 'You are too hard now to slap! But there you are:
Hobbits must stick together, and especially Bagginses. All I ask in return
is: take as much care of yourself as you can. and bring back all the news
you can, and any old songs and tales you can come by. I’ll do my best to
finish my book before you return. I should like to write the second book, if
I am spared.' He broke off and turned to the window again, singing softly. I sit beside the fire and think
of all that I have seen,
of meadow-flowers and butterflies
in summers that have been; Of yellow leaves and gossamer
in autumns that there were,
with morning mist and silver sun
and wind upon my hair. I sit beside the fire and think
of how the world will be
when winter comes without a spring
that I shall ever see. For still there are so many things
that I have never seen:
in every wood in every spring
there is a different green. I sit beside the fire and think
of people long ago,
and people who will see a world
that I shall never know. But all the while I sit and think
of times there were before, I listen for returning feet
and voices at the door. It was a cold grey day near the end of December. The East Wind was
streaming through the bare branches of the trees, and seething in the dark
pines on the hills. Ragged clouds were hurrying overhead, dark and low. As
the cheerless shadows of the early evening began to fall the Company made
ready to set out. They were to start at dusk, for Elrond counselled them to
journey under cover of night as often as they could, until they were far
from Ri vendell. 'You should fear the many eyes of the servants of Sauron,' he said. 'I
do not doubt that news of the discomfiture of the Riders has already reached
him, and he will be filled with wrath. Soon now his spies on foot and wing
will be abroad in the northern lands. Even of the sky above you must beware
as you go on your way.' The Company took little gear of war, for their hope was in secrecy not
in battle. Aragorn had And®ril but no other weapon, and he went forth clad
only in rusty green and brown, as a Ranger of the wilderness. Boromir had a
long sword, in fashion like And®ril but of less lineage and he bore also a
shield and his war -horn. 'Loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the hills,' he said, 'and
then let all the foes of Gondor flee!’ Putting it to his lips he blew a
blast, and the echoes leapt from rock to rock, and all that heard that voice
in Rivendell sprang to their feet. Slow should you be to wind that horn again, Boromir, said Elrond.
'until you stand once more on the borders of your land, and dire need is on
you.' 'Maybe,' said Boromir. 'But always I have let my horn cry at setting
forth, and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows, I will not go forth
as a thief in the night.' Gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt of steel-rings, for
dwarves make light of burdens; and in his belt was a broad-bladed axe.
Legolas had a bow and a quiver, and at his belt a long white knife. The
younger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken from the barrow; but
Frodo took only Sting; and his mail-coat, as Bilbo wished, remained hidden.
Gandalf bore his staff, but girt at his side was the elven-sword Glamdring,
the mate of Orcrist that lay now upon the breast of Thorin under the Lonely
Mountain. All were well furnished by Elrond with thick warm clothes, and they had
jackets and cloaks lined with fur. Spare food and clothes and blankets and
other needs were laden on a pony, none other than the poor beast that they
had brought from Bree. ?he stay in Rivendell had worked a great wonder of change on him: he
was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth. It was Sam who had
insisted on choosing him, declaring that Bill (as he called him) would pine,
if he did not come. 'That animal can nearly talk,' he said, 'and would talk, if he stayed
here much longer. He gave me a look as plain as Mr. Pippin could speak it:
if you don't let me go with you, Sam, I'll follow on my own.' So Bill was
going as the beast of burden, yet he was the only member of the Company that
did not seem depressed. Their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire, and they
were only waiting now for Gandalf, who had not yet come out of the house. A
gleam of firelight came from the open doors, and soft lights were glowing in
many windows. Bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside
Frodo. Aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees; only Elrond knew fully
what this hour meant to him. The others could be seen as grey shapes in the
darkness. Sam was standing by the pony, sucking his teeth, and staring moodily
into the gloom where the river roared stonily below; his desire for
adventure was at its lowest ebb. 'Bill, my lad,’ he said, 'you oughtn't to have took up with us. You
could have stayed here and et the best hay till the new grass comes.' Bill
swished his tail and said nothing. Sam eased the pack on his shoulders, and went over anxiously in his
mind all the things that he had stowed in it, wondering if he had forgotten
anything: his chief treasure, his cooking gear; and the little box of salt
that he always carried and refilled when he could; a good supply of
pipe- weed (but not near enough, I'll warrant); flint and tinder; woollen
hose: linen; various small belongings of his master's that Frodo had
forgotten and Sam had stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were
called for. He went through them all. 'Rope!' he muttered. 'No rope! And only last night you said to
yourself: "Sam, what about a bit of rope? You'll want it, if you haven't got
it:" Well, I'll want it. I can't get it now.' At that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf, and he called the Company
to him. 'This is my last word,' he said in a low voice. 'The Ring-bearer is
setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom. On him alone is any charge laid:
neither to cast away the Ring, nor to deliver it to any servant of the Enemy
nor indeed to let any handle it, save members of the Company and the
Council, and only then in gravest need. The others go with him as free
companions, to help him on his way. You may tarry, or come back, or turn
aside into other paths, as chance allows. The further you go, the less easy
will it be to withdraw; yet no oath or bond is laid on you to go further
than you will. For you do not yet know the strength of your hearts, and you
cannot foresee what each may meet upon the road.' 'Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens,' said Gimli. 'Maybe,' said Elrond, 'but let him not vow to walk in the dark, who has
not seen the nightfall.' 'Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,' said Gimli. 'Or break it,' said Elrond. 'Look not too far ahead! But go now with
good hearts ! Farewell, and may the blessing of Elves and Men and all Free
Folk go with you. May the stars shine upon your faces!’ 'Good . . . good luck!' cried Bilbo, stuttering with the cold. 'I don't
suppose you will be able to keep a diary, Frodo my lad, but I shall expect a
full account when you get back. And don't be too long! Farewell!' Many others of Elrond's household stood in the shadows and watched them
go, bidding them farewell with soft voices. There was no laughter, and no
song or music. At last they turned away and faded silently into the dusk. They crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that
led out of the cloven vale of Rivendell; and they came at length to the high
moor where the wind hissed through the heather. Then with one glance at the
Last Flomely Flouse twinkling below them they strode away far into the night. At the Ford of Bruinen they left the Road and turning southwards went
on by narrow paths among the folded lands. Their purpose was to hold this
course west of the Mountains for many miles and days. The country was
much rougher and more barren than in the green vale of the Great River in
Wilderland on the other side of the range, and their going would be slow;
but they hoped in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes. The
spies of Sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country, and the
paths were little known except to the people of Rivendell. Gandalf walked in front, and with him went Aragorn, who knew this land
even in the dark. The others were in file behind, and Legolas whose eyes
were keen was the rearguard. The first part of their journey was hard and
dreary, and Frodo remembered little of it, save the wind. For many sunless
days an icy blast came from the Mountains in the east, and no garment seemed
able to keep out its searching fingers. Though the Company was well clad,
they seldom felt warm, either moving or at rest. They slept uneasily during
the middle of the day, in some hollow of the land, or hidden under the
tangled thorn-bushes that grew in thickets in many places. In the late
afternoon they were roused by the watch, and took their chief meal: cold and
cheerless as a rule, for they could seldom risk the lighting of a fire. In
the evening they went on again, always as nearly southward as they could
find a way. At first it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked and
stumbled until they were weary, they were creeping forward like snails, and
getting nowhere. Each day the land looked much the same as it had the day
before. Yet steadily the mountains were drawing nearer. South of Rivendell
they rose ever higher, and bent westwards; and about the feet of the main
range there was tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills, and deep valleys
filled with turbulent waters. Paths were few and winding, and led them often
only to the edge of some sheer fall, or down into treacherous swamps. They had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed. The wind
suddenly fell and then veered round to the south. The swift-flowing clouds
lifted and melted away, and the sun came out, pale and bright. There came a
cold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night-march. The travellers
reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly -trees whose grey-green trunks
seemed to have been built out of the very stone of the hills. Their dark
leaves shone and their berries glowed red in the light of the rising sun. Away in the south Frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains
that seemed now to stand across the path that the Company was taking. At the
left of this high range rose three peaks; the tallest and nearest stood up
like a tooth tipped with snow; its great, bare, northern precipice was still
largely in the shadow, but where the sunlight slanted upon it, it glowed
red. Gandalf stood at Frodo’s side and looked out under his hand. 'We have
done well,’ he said. 'We have reached the borders of the country that Men
call Hollin; many Elves lived here in happier days, when Eregion was its
name. Five-and-forty leagues as the crow flies we have come, though many
long miles further our feet have walked. The land and the weather will be
milder now, but perhaps all the more dangerous.’ 'Dangerous or not, a real sunrise is mighty welcome,’ said Frodo,
throwing back his hood and letting the morning light fall on his face. ’But the mountains are ahead of us,’ said Pippin. 'We must have turned
eastwards in the night.’
'No,' said Gandalf. 'But you see further ahead in the clear light. Beyond those peaks the range bends round south-west. There are many maps
in Elrond's house, but I suppose you never thought to look at them?' 'Yes I did, sometimes,' said Pippin, 'but I don't remember them. Frodo
has a better head for that sort of thing.' 'I need no map,' said Gimli, who had come up with Legolas, and was
gazing out before him with a strange light in his deep eyes. 'There is the
land where our fathers worked of old, and we have wrought the image of those
mountains into many works of metal and of stone, and into many songs and
tales. They stand tall in our dreams: Baraz, Zirak, Shathyr. 'Only once before have I seen them from afar in waking life, but I know
them and their names, for under them lies Khazad-dym, the Dwarrowdelf, that
is now called the Black Pit, Moria in the Elvish tongue. Yonder stands
Barazinbar, the Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; and beyond him are Silvertine and
Cloudyhead: Celebdil the White, and Fanuidhol the Grey, that we call
Zirak-zigil and Bundushathyr. 'There the Misty Mountains divide, and between their arms lies the
deep-shadowed valley which we cannot forget: Azanulbizar, the Dimrill Dale,
which the Elves call Nanduhirion.' 'It is for the Dimrill Dale that we are making,' said Gandalf. 'If we
climb the pass that is called the Redhorn Gate, under the far side of
Caradhras, we shall come down by the Dimrill Stair into the deep vale of the
Dwarves. There lies the Mirrormere, and there the River Silverlode rises in
its icy springs.’ 'Dark is the water of Kheled-zvram,' said Gimli, 'and cold are the
springs of Kibil-nvla. My heart trembles at the thought that I may see them
soon.' 'May you have joy of the sight, my good dwarf f said Gandalf. 'But
whatever you may do, we at least cannot stay in that valley. We must go down
the Silverlode into the secret woods, and so to the Great River, and then f He paused. 'Yes, and where then?' asked Merry. 'To the end of the journey — in the end,' said Gandalf. 'We cannot
look too far ahead. Let us be glad that the first stage is safely over. I
think we will rest here, not only today but tonight as well. There is a
wholesome air about Hollin. Much evil must befall a country before it wholly
forgets the Elves, if once they dwelt there.’ That is true,' said Legolas. 'But the Elves of this land were of a
race strange to us of the silvan folk, and the trees and the grass do not
now remember them: Only I hear the stones lament them: deep they delved us,
fair they wrought us, high they builded us; but they are gone. They are
gone. They sought the Elavens long ago.' That morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great bushes
of holly, and their supper -breakfast was merrier than it had been since they
set out. They did not hurry to bed afterwards, for they expected to have all
the night to sleep in, and they did not mean to go on again until the
evening of the next day. Only Aragorn was silent and restless. After a while
he left the Company and wandered on to the ridge; there he stood in the
shadow of a tree, looking out southwards and westwards, with his head posed
as if he was listening. Then he returned to the brink of the dell and looked
down at the others laughing and talking. 'What is the matter, Strider?’ Merry called up. ’What are you looking
for? Do you miss the East Wind?’ ’No indeed,’ he answered. 'But I miss something. I have been in the
country of Hollin in many seasons. No folk dwell here now, but many other
creatures live here at all times, especially birds. Yet now all things but
you are silent. I can feel it. There is no sound for miles about us, and
your voices seem to make the ground echo. I do not understand it.’ Gandalf looked up with sudden interest. 'But what do you guess is the
reason?’ he asked. 'Is there more in it than surprise at seeing four
hobbits, not to mention the rest of us, where people are so seldom seen or
heard?’ 'I hope that is it,’ answered Aragorn. 'But I have a sense of
watchfulness, and of fear, that I have never had here before.’ "Then we must be more careful,’ said Gandalf. ’If you bring a Ranger
with you, it is well to pay attention to him, especially if the Ranger is
Aragorn. We must stop talking aloud, rest quietly, and set the watch.’ It was Sam’s turn that day to take the first watch, but Aragorn joined
him. The others fell asleep. Then the silence grew until even Sam felt it. The breathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard. The swish of the
pony’s tail and the occasional movements of his feet became loud noises. Sam
could hear his own joints creaking, if he stirred. Dead silence was around
him, and over all hung a clear blue sky, as the Sun rode up from the East.
Away in the South a dark patch appeared, and grew, and drove north like
flying smoke in the wind. 'What's that, Strider? It don’t look like a cloud,' said Sam in a
whisper to Aragorn. He made no answer, he was gazing intently at the sky;
but before long Sam could see for himself what was approaching. Flocks of
birds, flying at great speed, were wheeling and circling, and traversing all
the land as if they were searching for something; and they were steadily
drawing nearer. 'Lie flat and still!' hissed Aragorn, pulling Sam down into the shade
of a holly -bush; for a whole regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from
the main host, and came, flying low, straight towards the ridge. Sam thought
they were a kind of crow of large size. As they passed overhead, in so dense
a throng that their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below, one
harsh croak was heard. Not until they had dwindled into the distance, north and west, and the
sky was again clear would Aragorn rise. Then he sprang up and went and
wakened Gandalf. 'Regiments of black crows are flying over all the land between the
Mountains and the Greyflood,' he said, 'and they have passed over Hollin.
They are not natives here; they are crebain out of Fangorn and Dunland. I do
not know what they are about: possibly there is some trouble away south from
which they are fleeing; but I think they are spying out the land. I have
also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky. I think we ought to move
again this evening. Hollin is no longer wholesome for us: it is being
watched.' 'And in that case so is the Redhorn Gate,' said Gandalf; 'and how we
can get over that without being seen, I cannot imagine. But we will think of
that when we must. As for moving as soon as it is dark, I am afraid that you
are right.' 'Luckily our fire made little smoke, and had burned low before the
crebain came,' said Aragorn. 'It must be put out and not lit again.' 'Well if that isn't a plague and a nuisance!' said Pippin. The news: no
fire, and a move again by night, had been broken to him, as soon as he woke
in the late afternoon. 'All because of a pack of crows! I had looked forward
to a real good meal tonight: something hot.' 'Well, you can go on looking forward,' said Gandalf. 'There may be many
unexpected feasts ahead for you. For myself I should like a pipe to smoke in
comfort, and warmer feet. However, we are certain of one thing at any rate:
it will get warmer as we get south.' 'Too warm, I shouldn't wonder,' muttered Sam to Frodo. 'But I'm
beginning to think it's time we got a sight of that Fiery Mountain and saw
the end of the Road, so to speak. I thought at first that this here Redhorn,
or whatever its name is, might be it, till Gimli spoke his piece. A fair
jaw-cracker dwarf-language must be!' Maps conveyed nothing to Sam's mind,
and all distances in these strange lands seemed so vast that he was quite
out of his reckoning. All that day the Company remained in hiding. The dark birds passed over
now and again; but as the westering Sun grew red they disappeared
southwards. At dusk the Company set out, and turning now half east they
steered their course towards Caradhras, which far away still glowed faintly
red in the last light of the vanished Sun. One by one white stars sprang
forth as the sky faded. Guided by Aragorn they struck a good path. It looked to Frodo like the
remains of an ancient road, that had once been broad and well planned, from
Hollin to the mountain-pass. The Moon, now at the full, rose over the
mountains, and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black.
Many of them looked to have been worked by hands, though now they lay
tumbled and ruinous in a bleak, barren land. It was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn, and the moon
was low. Frodo looked up at the sky. Suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass
over the high stars, as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out
again. He shivered. 'Did you see anything pass over?' he whispered to Gandalf, who was just
ahead. 'No, but I felt it, whatever it was,' he answered. 'It may be nothing,
only a wisp of thin cloud.' 'It was moving fast then,' muttered Aragorn, 'and not with the wind.' Nothing further happened that night. The next morning dawned even
brighter than before. But the air was chill again; already the wind was
turning back towards the east. For two more nights they marched on, climbing
steadily but ever more slowly as their road wound up into the hills, and the
mountains towered up, nearer and nearer. On the third morning Caradhras rose
before them, a mighty peak, tipped with snow like silver, but with sheer
naked sides, dull red as if stained with blood. There was a black look in the sky, and the sun was wan. The wind had
gone now round to the north-east. Gandalf snuffed the air and looked back. 'Winter deepens behind us,' he said quietly to Aragorn. 'The heights
away north are whiter than they were; snow is lying far down their
shoulders. Tonight we shall be on our way high up towards the Redhorn Gate.
We may well be seen by watchers on that narrow path, and waylaid by some
evil; but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any. What do you
think of your course now, Aragorn?' Frodo overheard these words, and understood that Gandalf and Aragorn
were continuing some debate that had begun long before. He listened
anxiously. 'I think no good of our course from beginning to end, as you know well,
Gandalf,' answered Aragorn. 'And perils known and unknown will grow as we
go on. But we must go on; and it is no good our delaying the passage of the
mountains. Further south there are no passes, till one comes to the Gap of
Rohan. I do not trust that way since your news of Saruman. Who knows
which side now the marshals of the Horse-lords serve?’ 'Who knows indeed!' said Gandalf. 'But there is another way, and not by
the pass of Caradhras: the dark and secret way that we have spoken of.’ 'But let us not speak of it again! Not yet. Say nothing to the others I
beg, not until it is plain that there is no other way.' 'We must decide before we go further,' answered Gandalf. 'Then let us weigh the matter in our minds, while the others rest and
sleep,' said Aragorn. In the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their breakfast, Gandalf and Aragorn went aside together and stood looking at Caradhras. Its
sides were now dark and sullen, and its head was in grey cloud. Frodo
watched them, wondering which way the debate would go. When they returned
to the Company Gandalf spoke, and then he knew that it had been decided to face
the weather and the high pass. He was relieved. He could not guess what was
the other dark and secret way, but the very mention of it had seemed to fill
Aragorn with dismay, and Frodo was glad that it had been abandoned. 'From signs that we have seen lately,’ said Gandalf, ’I fear that the
Redhorn Gate may be watched; and also I have doubts of the weather that is
coming up behind. Snow may come. We must go with all the speed that we
can. Even so it will take us more than two marches before we reach the top of the
pass. Dark will come early this evening. We must leave as soon as you can
get ready.' 'I will add a word of advice, if I may,' said Boromir. 'I was born
under the shadow of the White Mountains and know something of journeys
in the high places. We shall meet bitter cold, if no worse, before we come down
on the other side. It will not help us to keep so secret that we are frozen
to death. When we leave here, where there are still a few trees and bushes,
each of us should carry a faggot of wood, as large as he can bear.' 'And Bill could take a bit more, couldn't you lad?' said Sam. The pony
looked at him mournfully. 'Very well,' said Gandalf. 'But we must not use the wood — not unless
it is a choice between fire and death.' The Company set out again with good speed at first; but soon their way
became steep and difficult. The twisting and climbing road had in many
places almost disappeared, and was blocked with many fallen stones. The
night grew deadly dark under great clouds. A bitter wind swirled among the
rocks. By midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountains. The
narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of cliffs to the left, above which
the grim flanks of Caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom; on the right
was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine. Laboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the
top. Frodo felt a soft touch on his face. He put out his arm and saw the dim
white flakes of snow settling on his sleeve. They went on. But before long the snow was falling fast, filling all
the air, and swirling into Frodo's eyes. The dark bent shapes of Gandalf and
Aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen. 'I don't like this at all,' panted Sam just behind. 'Snow's all right
on a fine morning, but I like to be in bed while it's falling. I wish this
lot would go off to Hobbiton! Folk might welcome it there.' Except on the
high moors of the Northfarthing a heavy fall was rare in the Shire, and was
regarded as a pleasant event and a chance for fun. No living hobbit (save
Bilbo) could remember the Fell Winter of 131 1, when the white wolves
invaded the Shire over the frozen Brandywine. Gandalf halted. Snow was thick on his hood and shoulders; it was
already ankle-deep about his boots. "This is what I feared,' he said. 'What do you say now, Aragorn?' 'That I feared it too,' Aragorn answered, 'but less than other things. I knew the risk of snow, though it seldom falls heavily so far south, save
high up in the mountains. But we are not high yet; we are still far down,
where the paths are usually open all the winter.' 'I wonder if this is a contrivance of the Enemy,' said Boromir. "They
say in my land that he can govern the storms in the Mountains of Shadow that
stand upon the borders of Mordor. He has strange powers and many allies.' 'His arm has grown long indeed,' said Gimli, 'if he can draw snow down
from the North to trouble us here three hundred leagues away.' 'His arm has grown long,' said Gandalf. While they were halted, the wind died down, and the snow slackened
until it almost ceased. They tramped on again. But they had not gone more
than a furlong when the storm returned with fresh fury. The wind whistled
and the snow became a blinding blizzard. Soon even Boromir found it hard to
keep going. The hobbits, bent nearly double, toiled along behind the taller
folk, but it was plain that they could not go much further, if the snow
continued. Frodo's feet felt like lead. Pippin was dragging behind. Even
Gimli, as stout as any dwarf could be, was grumbling as he trudged. The Company halted suddenly, as if they had come to an agreement
without any words being spoken. They heard eerie noises in the darkness
round them. It may have been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and
gullies of the rocky wall, but the sounds were those of shrill cries, and
wild howls of laughter. Stones began to fall from the mountain-side,
whistling over their heads, or crashing on the path beside them. Every now
and again they heard a dull rumble, as a great boulder rolled down from
hidden heights above. 'We cannot go further tonight,' said Boromir. 'Let those call it the
wind who will; there are fell voices on the air; and these stones are aimed
at us.' 'I do call it the wind,' said Aragorn. 'But that does not make what you
say untrue. There are many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have
little love for those that go on two legs, and yet are not in league with
Sauron, but have purposes of their own. Some have been in this world longer
than he.’ ’Caradhras was called the Cruel, and had an ill name, said Gimli, 'long
years ago, when rumour of Sauron had not been heard in these lands.' 'It matters little who is the enemy, if we cannot beat off his attack;
said Gandalf. 'But what can we do?' cried Pippin miserably. He was leaning on Merry
and Frodo, and he was shivering. 'Either stop where we are, or go back,' said Gandalf. ’It is no good
going on. Only a little higher, if I remember rightly, this path leaves the
cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long hard
slope. We should have no shelter there from snow, or stones — or anything
else.' 'And it is no good going back while the storm holds,' said Aragorn. 'We
have passed no place on the way up that offered more shelter than this
cliff-wall we are under now.' 'Shelter!' muttered Sam. 'If this is shelter, then one wall and no roof
make a house.' The Company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could. It faced southwards, and near the bottom it leaned out a little, so that
they hoped it would give them some protection from the northerly wind and
from the falling stones. But eddying blasts swirled round them from every
side, and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds. They huddled together with their backs to the wall. Bill the pony stood
patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits, and screened them a
little; but before long the drifting snow was above his hocks, and it went
on mounting. If they had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon
have been entirely buried. A great sleepiness came over Frodo; he felt himself sinking fast into a
warm and hazy dream. He thought a fire was heating his toes, and out of the
shadows on the other side of the hearth he heard Bilbo's voice speaking. /
don 't think much of your diary , he said. Snowstorms on January the twelfth:
there was no need to come back to report that! But I wanted rest and sleep, Bilbo , Frodo answered with an effort, when
he felt himself shaken, and he came back painfully to wakefulness. Boromir
had lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snow.
'This will be the death of the halflings, Gandalf,' said Boromir. 'It
is useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heads. We must do
something to save ourselves.’ 'Give them this,’ said Gandalf, searching in his pack and drawing out a
leathern flask. 'Just a mouthful each — for all of us. It is very precious. It is miruvor, the cordial of Imladris. Elrond gave it to me at our parting. Pass it round!’ As soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor
he felt a new strength of heart, and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs. The others also revived and found fresh hope and vigour. But the snow did
not relent. It whirled about them thicker than ever, and the wind blew
louder. ’What do you say to fire?’ asked Boromir suddenly. ’The choice seems
near now between fire and death, Gandalf. Doubtless we shall be hidden from
all unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us, but that will not help
us.’ ’You may make a fire, if you can,’ answered Gandalf. ’If there are any
watchers that can endure this storm, then they can see us, fire or no.’ But
though they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice of Boromir, it
passed the skill of Elf or even Dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid
the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel. At last reluctantly Gandalf
himself took a hand. Picking up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment, and
then with a word of command, naur an edraith ammen ! he thrust the end of his
staff into the midst of it. At once a great spout of green and blue flame
sprang out, and the wood flared and sputtered. 'If there are any to see, then I at least am revealed to them,’ he
said. ’I have written Gandalf is here in signs that all can read from
Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin.’ But the Company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes. Their
hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire. The wood burned merrily;
and though all round it the snow hissed, and pools of slush crept under
their feet, they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze. There they stood,
stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames. A red
light was on their tired and anxious faces; behind them the night was like a
black wall. But the wood was burning fast, and the snow still fell. The fire burned low. and the last faggot was thrown on.
The night is getting old,' said Aragorn. "The dawn is not far off.' 'If any dawn can pierce these clouds,' said Gimli. Boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness. 'The snow is growing less,' he said, 'and the wind is quieter.' Frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be
revealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire; but for a long
time he could see no sign of their slackening. Then suddenly, as sleep was
beginning to creep over him again, he was aware that the wind had indeed
fallen, and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer. Very slowly a dim
light began to grow. At last the snow stopped altogether. As the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world. Below
their refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which
the path that they had trodden was altogether lost; but the heights above
were hidden in great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow. Gimli looked up and shook his head. 'Caradhras has not forgiven us.' he
said. 'He has more snow yet to fling at us, if we go on. The sooner we go
back and down the better.' To this all agreed, but their retreat was now difficult. It might well
prove impossible. Only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay
many feet deep, higher than the heads of the hobbits; in places it had been
scooped and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff. 'If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame, he might melt a
path for you,' said Legolas. The storm had troubled him little, and he alone
of the Company remained still light of heart. 'If Elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch the Sun to save
us,’ answered Gandalf. 'But I must have something to work on. I cannot burn
snow.’ 'Well,' said Boromir, 'when heads are at a loss bodies must serve, as
we say in my country. The strongest of us must seek a way. See! Though all
is now snow-clad, our path, as we came up, turned about that shoulder of
rock down yonder. It was there that the snow first began to burden us. If we
could reach that point, maybe it would prove easier beyond. It is no more
than a furlong off, I guess.' 'Then let us force a path thither, you and I!’ said Aragorn. Aragorn was the tallest of the Company, but Boromir, little less in
height, was broader and heavier in build. He led the way, and Aragorn
followed him. Slowly they moved off, and were soon toiling heavily. In
places the snow was breast-high, and often Boromir seemed to be swimming
or burrowing with his great arms rather than walking. Legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips, and then
he turned to the others. 'The strongest must seek a way, say you? But I say:
let a ploughman plough, but choose an otter for swimming, and for running
light over grass and leaf or over snow-an Elf.' With that he sprang forth nimbly, and then Frodo noticed as if for the
first time, though he had long known it, that the Elf had no boots, but wore
only light shoes, as he always did, and his feet made little imprint in the
snow. 'Farewell!' he said to Gandalf. 'I go to find the Sun!' Then swift as a
runner over firm sand he shot away, and quickly overtaking the toiling men,
with a wave of his hand he passed them, and sped into the distance, and
vanished round the rocky turn. The others waited huddled together, watching until Boromir and Aragorn
dwindled into black specks in the whiteness. At length they too passed from
sight. The time dragged on. The clouds lowered, and now a few flakes of snow
came curling down again. An hour, maybe, went by, though it seemed far longer, and then at last
they saw Legolas coming back. At the same time Boromir and Aragorn
reappeared round the bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope. 'Well,' cried Legolas as he ran up, 'I have not brought the Sun. She is
walking in the blue fields of the South, and a little wreath of snow on this
Redhorn hillock troubles her not at all. But I have brought back a gleam of
good hope for those who are doomed to go on feet. There is the greatest
wind-drift of all just beyond the turn, and there our Strong Men were almost
buried. They despaired, until I returned and told them that the drift was
little wider than a wall. And on the other side the snow suddenly grows
less, while further down it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a
hobbit's toes.' 'Ah, it is as I said,' growled Gimli. 'It was no ordinary storm. It is
the ill will of Caradhras. He does not love Elves and Dwarves, and that
drift was laid to cut off our escape.' 'But happily your Caradhras has forgotten that you have Men with you,'
said Boromir, who came up at that moment. 'And doughty Men too, if I may
say
it; though lesser men with spades might have served you better. Still, we
have thrust a lane through the drift; and for that all here may be grateful
who cannot run as light as Elves.' 'But how are we to get down there, even if you have cut through the
drift?' said Pippin, voicing the thought of all the hobbits. 'Have hope!' said Boromir. 'I am weary, but I still have some strength
left, and Aragorn too. We will bear the little folk. The others no doubt
will make shift to tread the path behind us. Come, Master Peregrin! I will
begin with you.' He lifted up the hobbit. 'Cling to my back! I shall need my arms' he
said and strode forward. Aragorn with Merry came behind. Pippin marvelled at
his strength, seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other
tool than his great limbs. Even now, burdened as he was, he was widening the
track for those who followed, thrusting the snow aside as he went. They came at length to the great drift. It was flung across the
mountain-path like a sheer and sudden wall, and its crest, sharp as if
shaped with knives, reared up more than twice the height of Boromir; but
through the middle a passage had been beaten, rising and falling like a
bridge. On the far side Merry and Pippin were set down, and there they
waited with Legolas for the rest of the Company to arrive. After a while Boromir returned carrying Sam. Behind in the narrow but
now well-trodden track came Gandalf, leading Bill with Gimli perched among
the baggage. Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo. They passed through the lane;
but hardly had Frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled
down a fall of stones and slithering snow. The spray of it half blinded the
Company as they crouched against the cliff, and when the air cleared again
they saw that the path was blocked behind them. 'Enough, enough!' cried Gimli. 'We are departing as quickly as we may!'
And indeed with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be
expended, as if Caradhras was satisfied that the invaders had been beaten
off and would not dare to return. The threat of snow lifted; the clouds
began to break and the light grew broader. As Legolas had reported, they found that the snow became steadily more
shallow as they went down, so that even the hobbits could trudge along. Soon
they all stood once more on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope
where they had felt the first flakes of snow the night before. The morning was now far advanced. From the high place they looked back
westwards over the lower lands. Far away in the tumble of country that lay
at the foot of the mountain was the dell from which they had started to
climb the pass. Frodo’s legs ached. He was chilled to the bone and hungry; and his head
was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhill. Black specks
swam before his eyes. He rubbed them, but the black specks remained. In the
distance below him, but still high above the lower foothills, dark dots were
circling in the air. 'The birds again!’ said Aragorn, pointing down. That cannot be helped now,’ said Gandalf. 'Whether they are good or
evil, or have nothing to do with us at all, we must go down at once. Not
even on the knees of Caradhras will we wait for another night-fall!’ A cold wind flowed down behind them, as they turned their backs on the
Redhorn Gate, and stumbled wearily down the slope. Caradhras had defeated
them.
Chapter 4 . A Journey in the Dark It was evening, and the grey light was again waning fast, when they
halted for the night. They were very weary. The mountains were veiled in
deepening dusk, and the wind was cold. Gandalf spared them one more
mouthful each of the miruvor of Rivendell. When they had eaten some food he called a
council. 'We cannot, of course, go on again tonight,' he said. 'The attack on
the Redhorn Gate has tired us out, and we must rest here for a while.' 'And then where are we to go? ’ asked Frodo. 'We still have our journey and our errand before us,' answered Gandalf. 'We have no choice but to go on, or to return to Rivendell.' Pippin's face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to
Rivendell; Merry and Sam looked up hopefully. But Aragorn and Boromir
made no sign. Frodo looked troubled. 'I wish I was back there,’ he said. 'But how can I return without shame
— unless there is indeed no other way, and we are already defeated? ’ 'You are right, Frodo,' said Gandalf: 'to go back is to admit defeat
and face worse defeat to come. If we go back now, then the Ring must remain
there: we shall not be able to set out again. Then sooner or later Rivendell
will be besieged, and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed. The Ringwraiths are deadly enemies, but they are only shadows yet of the
power and terror they would possess if the Ruling Ring was on their master's
hand again.' 'Then we must go on, if there is a way,' said Frodo with a sigh. Sam
sank back into gloom. 'There is a way that we may attempt,' said Gandalf. I thought from the
beginning, when first I considered this journey, that we should try it. But
it is not a pleasant way, and I have not spoken of it to the Company before.
Aragorn was against it, until the pass over the mountains had at least been
tried.' 'If it is a worse road than the Redhorn Gate, then it must be evil
indeed,' said Merry. 'But you had better tell us about it, and let us know
the worst at once.' 'The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria,' said Gandalf. Only Gimli lifted up his head; a smouldering fire was in his eyes. On all
the others a dread fell at the mention of that name. Even to the hobbits it
was a legend of vague fear: 'The road may lead to Moria, but how can we hope that it will lead
through Moria? ’ said Aragorn darkly. 'It is a name of ill omen,' said Boromir. 'Nor do I see the need to go
there. If we cannot cross the mountains, let us journey southwards, until we
come to the Gap of Rohan, where men are friendly to my people, taking the
road that I followed on my way hither. Or we might pass by and cross the
Isen into Langstrand and Lebennin, and so come to Gondor from the regions
nigh to the sea.’ 'Things have changed since you came north, Boromir,' answered Gandalf.
'Did you not hear what I told you of Saruman? With him I may have business
of my own ere all is over. But the Ring must not come near Isengard, if that
can by any means be prevented. The Gap of Rohan is closed to us while we go
with the Bearer. 'As for the longer road: we cannot afford the time. We might spend a
year in such a journey, and we should pass through many lands that are empty
and harbourless. Yet they would not be safe. The watchful eyes both of
Saruman and of the Enemy are on them. When you came north, Boromir, you
were in the Enemy's eyes only one stray wanderer from the South and a matter of
small concern to him: his mind was busy with the pursuit of the Ring. But
you return now as a member of the Ring's Company, and you are in peril as
long as you remain with us. The danger will increase with every league that
we go south under the naked sky. 'Since our open attempt on the mountain -pass our plight has become more
desperate, I fear. I see now little hope, if we do not soon vanish from
sight for a while, and cover our trail. Therefore I advise that we should go
neither over the mountains, nor round them, but under them. That is a road
at any rate that the Enemy will least expect us to take.’ 'We do not know what he expects,' said Boromir. 'lie may watch all
roads, likely and unlikely. In that case to enter Moria would be to walk
into a trap, hardly better than knocking at the gates of the Dark Tower
itself. The name of Moria is black.' 'You speak of what you do not know, when you liken Moria to the
stronghold of Sauron,' answered Gandalf. 'I alone of you have ever been in
the dungeons of the Dark Lord, and only in his older and lesser dwelling in
Dol Guldur. Those who pass the gates of Barad-dyr do not return. But I would
not lead you into Moria if there were no hope of coming out again. If there
are Ores there, it may prove ill for us, that is true. But most of the Ores
of the Misty Mountains were scattered or destroyed in the Battle of Five
Armies. The Eagles report that Ores are gathering again from afar; but there
is a hope that Moria is still free. 'There is even a chance that Dwarves are there, and that in some deep
hall of his fathers, Balin son of Fundin may be found. However it may prove,
one must tread the path that need chooses!’ ’I will tread the path with you, Gandalf! ’ said Gimli. ’I will go and
look on the halls of Durin, whatever may wait there-if you can find the
doors that are shut.’ 'Good, Gimli! ' said Gandalf. 'You encourage me. We will seek the
hidden doors together. And we will come through. In the ruins of the
Dwarves, a dwarfs head will be less easy to bewilder than Elves or Men or
Hobbits. Yet it will not be the first time that I have been to Moria. I
sought there long for Thrbin son of Thrur after he was lost. I passed
through, and I came out again alive! ’ 'I too once passed the Dimrill Gate,' said Aragorn quietly; 'but though
I also came out again, the memory is very evil. I do not wish to enter Moria
a second time.' 'And I don't wish to enter it even once,' said Pippin. 'Nor me,' muttered Sam. 'Of course not! ' said Gandalf. 'Who would? But the question is: who
will follow me, if I lead you there? ' 'I will,' said Gimli eagerly. 'I will,' said Aragorn heavily. 'You followed my lead almost to
disaster in the snow, and have said no word of blame. I will follow your
lead now — if this last warning does not move you. It is not of the Ring,
nor of us others that I am thinking now, but of you, Gandalf. And I say to
you: if you pass the doors of Moria, beware! ’ 'I will not go,' said Boromir; 'not unless the vote of the whole
company is against me. What do Legolas and the little folk say? The
Ring-bearer's voice surely should be heard? ’ I do not wish to go to Moria,' said Legolas. The hobbits said nothing. Sam looked at Frodo. At last Frodo spoke. 'I
do not wish to go,' he said; 'but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of
Gandalf. I beg that there should be no vote, until we have slept on it.
Gandalf will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this cold
gloom. How the wind howls ! ' At these words all fell into silent thought. They heard the wind
hissing among the rocks and trees, and there was a howling and wailing round
them in the empty spaces of the night. Suddenly Aragorn leapt to his feet. 'How the wind howls ! ' he cried. 'It is howling with wolf-voices. The Wargs have come west of the Mountains! f 'Need we wait until morning then? ' said Gandalf. 'It is as I said. The
hunt is up! Even if we live to see the dawn, who now will wish to journey
south by night with the wild wolves on his trail? ’ 'How far is Moria? ' asked Boromir. 'There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles as the
crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,' answered Gandalf grimly. 'Then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if we can,' said
Boromir. 'The wolf that one hears is worse than the ore that one fears.' 'True!' said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath. 'But where the
warg howls, there also the ore prowls.' 'I wish I had taken Elrond's advice,' muttered Pippin to Sam. I am no
good after all. There is not enough of the breed of Bandobras the Bullroarer
in me: these howls freeze my blood. I don't ever remember feeling so
wretched.' 'My heart's right down in my toes, Mr. Pippin,' said Sam. 'But we
aren't etten yet, and there are some stout folk here with us. Whatever may
be in store for old Gandalf, I'll wager it isn't a wolfs belly.' For their defence in the night the Company climbed to the top of the
small hill under which they had been sheltering, it was crowned with a knot
of old and twisted trees, about which lay a broken circle of boulder stones. In the midst of this they lit a fire, for there was no hope that darkness
and silence would keep their trail from discovery by the hunting packs. Round the fire they sat, and those that were not on guard dozed
uneasily. Poor Bill the pony trembled and sweated where he stood. The
howling of the wolves was now all round them, sometimes nearer and
sometimes further off. In the dead of the night many shining eyes were seen peering
over the brow of the hill. Some advanced almost to the ring of stones. At a
gap in the circle a great dark wolf-shape could be seen halted, gazing at
them. A shuddering howl broke from him, as if he were a captain summoning
his pack to the assault. Gandalf stood up and strode forward, holding his staff aloft. 'Listen, Hound of Sauron! ’ he cried. 'Gandalf is here. Fly, if you value your foul
skin! I will shrivel you from tail to snout, if you come within this ring.' The wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap. At that
moment there was a sharp twang. Legolas had loosed his bow. There was a
hideous yell, and the leaping shape thudded to the ground; the elvish arrow
had pierced its throat. The watching eyes were suddenly extinguished.
Gandalf and Aragorn strode forward, but the hill was deserted; the hunting
packs had fled. All about them the darkness grew silent, and no cry came on
the sighing wind. The night was old, and westward the waning moon was setting, gleaming
fitfully through the breaking clouds. Suddenly Frodo started from sleep.
Without warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and wild all about the
camp. A great host of Wargs had gathered silently and was now attacking them
from every side at once. 'Fling fuel on the fire!’ cried Gandalf to the hobbits. 'Draw your
blades, and stand back to back!’ In the leaping light, as the fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw many grey
shapes spring over the ring of stones. More and more followed. Through the
throat of one huge leader Aragorn passed his sword with a thrust; with a
great sweep Boromir hewed the head off another. Beside them Gimli stood
with his stout legs apart, wielding his dwarf-axe. The bow of Legolas was
singing. In the wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up,
a great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of stone set
upon a hill. Stooping like a cloud, he lifted a burning branch and strode to
meet the wolves. They gave back before him. High in the air he tossed the
blazing brand. It flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning; and
his voice rolled like thunder.
' Naur an edraith ammen! Naur dan i ngaurhoth!' he cried. There was a roar and a crackle, and the tree above him burst into a
leaf and bloom of blinding flame. The fire leapt from tree-top to tree -top. The whole hill was crowned with dazzling light. The swords and knives of the
defenders shone and flickered. The last arrow of Legolas kindled in the air
as it flew, and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf-chieftain. All the others fled. Slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash and sparks;
a bitter smoke curled above the burned tree-stumps, and blew darkly from the
hill, as the first light of dawn came dimly in the sky. Their enemies were
routed and did not return. 'What did I tell you, Mr. Pippin? ' said Sam, she/thing his sword. 'Wolves won’t get him. That was an eye-opener, and no mistake! Nearly singed
the hair off my head!’ When the full light of the morning came no signs of the wolves were to
be found, and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead. No trace of
the fight remained but the charred trees and the arrows of Legolas lying on
the hill-top. All were undamaged save one of which only the point was left. 'It is as I feared,’ said Gandalf. 'These were no ordinary wolves
hunting for food in the wilderness. Let us eat quickly and go!’ That day the weather changed again, almost as if it was at the command
of some power that had no longer any use for snow, since they had retreated
from the pass, a power that wished now to have a clear light in which things
that moved in the wild could be seen from far away. The wind had been
turning through north to north-west during the night, and now it failed. The
clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened, high and blue. As they
stood upon the hill-side, ready to depart, a pale sunlight gleamed over the
mountain-tops. 'We must reach the doors before sunset,’ said Gandalf, ’or I fear we
shall not reach them at all. It is not far, but our path may be winding, for
here Aragorn cannot guide us; he has seldom walked in this country, and only
once have I been under the west wall of Moria, and that was long ago. 'There it lies,’ he said, pointing away south-eastwards to where the
mountains' sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet. In the distance
could be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs, and in their midst, taller than
the rest, one great grey wall. 'When we left the pass I led you southwards,
and not back to our starting point, as some of you may have noticed. It is
well that I did so, for now we have several miles less to cross, and haste
is needed. Let us go! ' 'I do not know which to hope,' said Boromir grimly: 'that Gandalf will
find what he seeks, or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost
for ever. All choices seem ill, and to be caught between wolves and the wall
the likeliest chance. Lead on!’ Gimli now walked ahead by the wizard’s side, so eager was he to come to
Moria. Together they led the Company back towards the mountains. The only
road of old to Moria from the west had lain along the course of a stream,
the Sirannon, that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors
had stood. But either Gandalf was astray, or else the land had changed in
recent years; for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it,
only a few miles southwards from their start. The morning was passing towards noon, and still the Company wandered
and scrambled in a barren country of red stones. Nowhere could they see any
gleam of water or hear any sound of it. All was bleak and dry. Their hearts
sank. They saw no living thing, and not a bird was in the sky; but what the
night would bring, if it caught them in that lost land, none of them cared
to think. Suddenly Gimli, who had pressed on ahead, called back to them. He was
standing on a knoll and pointing to the right. Hurrying up they saw below
them a deep and narrow channel. It was empty and silent, and hardly a
trickle of water flowed among the brown and red-stained stones of its bed;
but on the near side there was a path, much broken and decayed, that wound
its way among the ruined walls and paving-stones of an ancient highroad. ’Ah! Here it is at last! ' said Gandalf. 'This is where the stream ran: Sirannon, the Gate-stream, they used to call it. But what has happened to
the water, I cannot guess; it used to be swift and noisy. Come! We must
hurry on. We are late.' The Company were footsore and tired; but they trudged doggedly along
the rough and winding track for many miles. The sun turned from the noon and
began to go west. After a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again.
Before them the mountains frowned, but their path lay in a deep trough of
land and they could see only the higher shoulders and the far eastward
peaks. At length they came to a sharp bend. There the road, which had been
veering southwards between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the
land to the left, turned and went due east again. Rounding the corner they
saw before them a low cliff, some five fathoms high, with a broken and
jagged top. Over it a trickling water dripped, through a wide cleft that
seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been strong and full. 'Indeed things have changed! ' said Gandalf. 'But there is no mistaking
the place. There is all that remains of the Stair Falls. If I remember
right, there was a flight of steps cut in the rock at their side, but the
main road wound away left and climbed with several loops up to the level
ground at the top. There used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right
up to the Walls of Moria, and the Sirannon flowed through it with the road
beside it. Let us go and see what things are like now ! ' They found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli sprang swiftly
up them, followed by Gandalf and Frodo. When they reached the top they saw
that they could go no further that way, and the reason for the drying up of
the Gate-stream was revealed. Behind them the sinking Sun filled the cool
western sky with glimmering gold. Before them stretched a dark still lake.
Neither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surface. The Sirannon had
been dammed and had filled all the valley. Beyond the ominous water were
reared vast cliffs, their stern faces pallid in the fading light: final and
impassable. No sign of gate or entrance, not a fissure or crack could Frodo
see in the frowning stone. 'There are the Walls of Moria,' said Gandalf, pointing across the
water. 'And there the Gate stood once upon a time, the Elven Door at the end
of the road from Flollin by which we have come. But this way is blocked. None
of the Company, I guess, will wish to swim this gloomy water at the end of
the day. It has an unwholesome look.’ 'We must find a way round the northern edge,' said Gimli. 'The first
thing for the Company to do is to climb up by the main path and see where
that will lead us. Even if there were no lake, we could not get our
baggage-pony up this stair.' 'But in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the Mines,’ said
Gandalf. 'The road under the mountains is a dark road, and there are places
narrow and steep which he cannot tread, even if we can.’ 'Poor old Bill! ' said Frodo. 'I had not thought of that. And poor Sam! I wonder what he will say? ’ 'I am sorry,' said Gandalf. 'Poor Bill has been a useful companion and
it goes to my heart to turn him adrift now. I would have travelled lighter
and brought no animal, least of all this one that Sam is fond of, if I had
had my way. I feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road.’ The day was drawing to its end, and cold stars were glinting in the sky
high above the sunset, when the Company, with all the speed they could,
climbed up the slopes and reached the side of the lake. In breadth it looked
to be no more than two or three furlongs at the widest point. How far it
stretched away southward they could not see in the failing light; but its
northern end was no more than half a mile from where they stood, and between
the stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the water's edge there was a
rim of open ground. They hurried forward, for they had still a mile or two
to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that Gandalf was
making for; and then he had still to find the doors. When they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they found a
narrow creek that barred their way. It was green and stagnant, thrust out
like a slimy arm towards the enclosing hills. Gimli strode forward
undeterred, and found that the water was shallow, no more than ankle-deep at
the edge. Behind him they walked in file, threading their way with care, for
under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy stones, and footing was
treacherous. Frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark unclean
water on his feet. As Sam, the last of the Company, led Bill up on to the dry ground on
the far side, there came a soft sound: a swish, followed by a plop, as if a
fish had disturbed the still surface of the water. Turning quickly they saw
ripples, black-edged with shadow in the waning light: great rings were
widening outwards from a point far out in the lake. There was a bubbling
noise, and then silence. The dusk deepened, and the last gleams of the
sunset were veiled in cloud. Gandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others followed as
quickly as they could. They reached the strip of dry land between the lake
and the cliffs: it was narrow, often hardly a dozen yards across, and
encumbered with fallen rock and stones; but they found a way, hugging the
cliff, and keeping as far from the dark water as they might. A mile
southwards along the shore they came upon holly trees. Stumps and dead
boughs were rotting in the shallows, the remains it seemed of old thickets,
or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley. But
close under the cliff there stood, still strong and living, . two tall
trees, larger than any trees of holly that Frodo had ever seen or imagined.
Their great roots spread from the wall to the water. Under the looming
cliffs they had looked like mere bushes, when seen far off from the top of
the Stair; but now they towered overhead, stiff, dark, and silent, throwing
deep night-shadows about their feet, standing like sentinel pillars at the
end of the road. 'Well, here we are at last! 'said Gandalf. 'Here the Elven-way from
Hollin ended. Holly was the token of the people of that land, and they
planted it here to mark the end of their domain; for the West -door was made
chiefly for their use in their traffic with the Lords of Moria. Those were
happier days, when there was still close friendship at times between folk of
different race, even between Dwarves and Elves.' 'It was not the fault of the Dwarves that the friendship waned,' said
Gimli. 'I have not heard that it was the fault of the Elves,' said Legolas. 'I have heard both,' said Gandalf; 'and I will not give judgement now. But I beg you two, Legolas and Gimli, at least to be friends, and to help
me. I need you both. The doors are shut and hidden, and the sooner we find
them the better. Night is at hand! ' Turning to the others he said: 'While I am searching, will you each
make ready to enter the Mines? For here I fear we must say farewell to our
good beast of burden. You must lay aside much of the stuff that we brought
against bitter weather: you will not need it inside, nor, I hope, when we
come through and journey on down into the South. Instead each of us must
take a share of what the pony carried, especially the food and the
water-skins.' 'But you can't leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken place, Mr.
Gandalf! ' cried Sam, angry and distressed. 'I won't have it, and that's
flat. After he has come so far and all ! ' 'I am sorry, Sam,' said the wizard. 'But when the Door opens I do not
think you will be able to drag your Bill inside, into the long dark of
Moria. You will have to choose between Bill and your master.’ 'He'd follow Mr. Frodo into a dragon's den, if I led him,' protested
Sam. 'It'd be nothing short of murder to turn him loose with all these
wolves about.' 'It will be short of murder, I hope,' said Gandalf. He laid his hand on
the pony's head, and spoke in a low voice. 'Go with words of guard and
guiding on you,’ he said. 'You are a wise beast, and have learned much in
Rivendell. Make your ways to places where you can find grass, and so come in
time to Elrond's house, or wherever you wish to go. 'There, Sam! He will have quite as much chance of escaping wolves and
getting home as we have.’ Sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer. Bill, seeming to
understand well what was going on, nuzzled up to him, putting his nose to
Sam's ear. Sam burst into tears, and fumbled with the straps, unlading all
the pony's packs and throwing them on the ground. The others sorted out the
goods, making a pile of all that could be left behind, and dividing up the
rest. When this was done they turned to watch Gandalf. He appeared to have
done nothing. He was standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall
of the cliff, as if he would bore a hole into it with his eyes. Gimli was
wandering about, tapping the stone here and there with his axe. Legolas was
pressed against the rock, as if listening. 'Well, here we are and all ready,' said Merry; 'but where are the
Doors? I can't see any sign of them.' 'Dwarf-doors are not made to be seen when shut,' said Gimli. 'They are
invisible, and their own masters cannot find them or open them, if their
secret is forgotten.' 'But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to Dwarves,' said
Gandalf, coming suddenly to life and turning round. 'Unless things are
altogether changed, eyes that know what to look for may discover the signs.’ He walked forward to the wall. Right between the shadow of the trees
there was a smooth space, and over this he passed his hands to and fro,
muttering words under his breath. Then he stepped back. 'Look!' he said. 'Can you see anything now?’ The Moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock; but they could see
nothing else for a while. Then slowly on the surface, where the wizard's
hands had passed, faint lines appeared, like slender veins of silver running
in the stone. At first they were no more than pale gossamer-threads, so fine
that they only twinkled fitfully where the Moon caught them, but steadily
they grew broader and clearer, until their design could be guessed. At the top, as high as Gandalf could reach, was an arch of interlacing
letters in an Elvish character. Below, though the threads were in places
blurred or broken, the outline could be seen of an anvil and a hammer
surmounted by a crown with seven stars. Beneath these again were two trees,
each bearing crescent moons. More clearly than all else there shone forth in
the middle of the door a single star with many rays. 'There are the emblems of Dunn!' cried Gimli. 'And there is the Tree of the High Elves!' said Legolas. 'And the Star of the House of Flanor,' said Gandalf. 'They are wrought
of ithildin that mirrors only starlight and moonlight, and sleeps until it
is touched by one who speaks words now long forgotten in Middle-earth. It is
long since I heard them, and I thought deeply before I could recall them to
my mind.’ ’What does the writing say?’ asked Frodo, who was trying to decipher
the inscription on the arch. ’I thought I knew the elf-letters but I cannot
read these.’ 'The words are in the elven-tongue of the West of Middle-earth in the
Elder Days,’ answered Gandalf. ’But they do not say anything of importance
to us. They say only: The Doors ofDurin, Lord ofMoria. Speak, friend, and
enter. And underneath small and faint is written: I, Narvi, made them.
Celebrimbor ofHollin drew these signs.' 'What does it mean by speak, friend, and enter!' asked Merry. ’That is plain enough,’ said Gimli. 'If you are a friend, speak the
password, and the doors will open, and you can enter.’ ’Yes,' said Gandalf, 'these doors are probably governed by words. Some
dwarf-gates will open only at special times, or for particular persons; and
some have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary times and
words are known. These doors have no key. In the days of Durin they were not
secret. They usually stood open and doorwards sat here. But if they were
shut, any who knew the opening word could speak it and pass in. At least so
it is recorded, is it not, Gimli? ' 'It is,' said the dwarf. 'But what the word was is not remembered. Narvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth.’ ’But do not you know the word, Gandalf? ’ asked Boromir in surprise. 'No! ’ said the wizard. The others looked dismayed; only Aragorn, who knew Gandalf well,
remained silent and unmoved. ’Then what was the use of bringing us to this accursed spot?’ cried
Boromir, glancing back with a shudder at the dark water. 'You told us that
you had once passed through the Mines. How could that be, if you did not
know how to enter? ' 'The answer to your first question, Boromir,’ said the wizard, 'is that
I do not know the word-yet. But we shall soon see. And,’ he added, with a
glint in his eyes under their bristling brows, 'you may ask what is the use
of my deeds when they are proved useless. As for your other question: do you
doubt my tale? Or have you no wits left? I did not enter this way. I came
from the East. 'If you wish to know, I will tell you that these doors open outwards. From the inside you may thrust them open with your hands. From the outside
nothing will move them save the spell of command. They cannot be forced
inwards.’ 'What are you going to do then? ’ asked Pippin, undaunted by the
wizard's bristling brows. 'Knock on the doors with your head, Peregrin Took,' said Gandalf. 'But
if that does not shatter them, and I am allowed a little peace from foolish
questions, I will seek for the opening words. 'I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves or Men or Ores
that was ever used for such a purpose. I can still remember ten score of
them without searching in my mind. But only a few trials, I think, will be
needed; and I shall not have to call on Gimli for words of the secret
dwarf-tongue that they teach to none. The opening words were Elvish, like
the writing on the arch: that seems certain.' Ele stepped up to the rock again, and lightly touched with his staff the
silver star in the middle beneath the sign of the anvil. Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen! Fennas nogothrim, lasto beth lammen! he said in a commanding voice. The silver lines faded, but the blank
grey stone did not stir. Many times he repeated these words in different order, or varied them.
Then he tried other spells, one after another, speaking now faster and
louder, now soft and slow. Then he spoke many single words of Elvish speech.
Nothing happened. The cliff towered into the night, the countless stars were
kindled, the wind blew cold, and the doors stood fast. Again Gandalf approached the wall, and lifting up his arms he spoke in
tones of command and rising wrath. Edro, edro! he cried, and struck the rock
with his staff. Open, open! he shouted, and followed it with the same
command in every language that had ever been spoken in the West of
Middle-earth. Then he threw his staff on the ground, and sat down in
silence. At that moment from far off the wind bore to their listening ears the
howling of wolves. Bill the pony started in fear, and Sam sprang to his side
and whispered softly to him. 'Do not let him run away! ' said Boromir. 'It seems that we shall need
him still, if the wolves do not find us. How I hate this foul pool! ' He
stooped and picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water. The stone vanished with a soft slap; but at the same instant there was
a swish and a bubble. Great rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond
where the stone had fallen, and they moved slowly towards the foot of the
cliff. ’Why did you do that, Boromir? ' said Frodo. V I hate this place, too,
and I am afraid. I don't know of what: not of wolves, or the dark behind the
doors, but of something else. I am afraid of the pool. Don't disturb it! ' '1 wish we could get away! ' said Merry. 'Why doesn't Gandalf do something quick? ' said Pippin. Gandalf took no notice of them. He sat with his head bowed, either in
despair or in anxious thought. The mournful howling of the wolves was heard
again. The ripples on the water grew and came closer; some were already
lapping on the shore. With a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet. He was laughing! V I have it! ' he cried. 'Of course, of course! Absurdly
simple, like most riddles when you see the answer.' Picking up his staff he stood before the rock and said in a clear
voice: Mellon! The star shone out briefly and faded again. Then silently a great
doorway was outlined, though not a crack or joint had been visible before.
Slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch by inch, until both
doors lay back against the wall. Through the opening a shadowy stair could
be seen climbing steeply up; but beyond the lower steps the darkness was
deeper than the night. The Company stared in wonder. V I was wrong after all,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli too. Merry, of all
people, was on the right track. The opening word was inscribed on the
archway all the time! The translation should have been: Say "Friend" and
enter. I had only to speak the Elvish word for friend and the doors opened.
Quite simple. Too simple for a learned lore-master in these suspicious days.
Those were happier times. Now let us go!' He strode forward and set his foot on the lowest step. But at that
moment several things happened. Frodo felt something seize him by the ankle,
and he fell with a cry. Bill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear, and turned
tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness. Sam leaped after
him, and then hearing Frodo’s cry he ran back again, weeping and cursing.
The others swung round and saw the waters of the lake seething, as if a host
of snakes were swimming up from the southern end. Out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled; it was
pale-green and luminous and wet. Its fingered end had hold of Frodo's foot
and was dragging him into the water. Sam on his knees was now slashing at it
with a knife. The arm let go of Frodo, and Sam pulled him away, crying out for help.
Twenty others arms came rippling out. The dark water boiled, and there was a
hideous stench. 'Into the gateway! Up the stairs! Quick! ' shouted Gandalf leaping
back. Rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but Sam to
the ground where they stood, he drove them forward. They were just in time. Sam and Frodo were only a few steps up, and
Gandalf had just begun to climb, when the groping tentacles writhed across
the narrow shore and fingered the cliff- wall and the doors. One came
wriggling over the threshold, glistening in the starlight. Gandalf turned
and paused. If he was considering what word would close the gate again from
within, there was no need. Many coiling arms seized the doors on either
side, and with horrible strength, swung them round. With a shattering echo
they slammed, and all light was lost. A noise of rending and crashing came
dully through the ponderous stone. Sam, clinging to Frodo’s arm, collapsed on a step in the black
darkness. 'Poor old Bill! ’ he said in a choking voice. 'Poor old Bill!
Wolves and snakes! But the snakes were too much for him. I had to choose,
Mr. Frodo. I had to come with you.’ They heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against
the doors. There was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled, .but the
doors did not open. 'Well, well! ’ said the wizard. 'The passage is blocked
behind us now and there is only one way out— on the other side of the
mountains. I fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled up, and the
trees uprooted and thrown across the gate. I am sorry; for the trees were
beautiful, and had stood so long.' 'I felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my foot
first touched the water,' said Frodo. 'What was the thing, or were there
many of them? ' 'I do not know,' answered Gandalf, 'but the arms were all guided by one
purpose. Something has crept, or has been driven out of dark waters under
the mountains. There are older and fouler things than Ores in the deep
places of the world.' He did not speak aloud his thought that whatever it
was that dwelt in the lake, it had seized on Frodo first among all the
Company. Boromir muttered under his breath, but the echoing stone magnified the
sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear: 'In the deep places of the
world! And thither we are going against my wish. Who will lead us nowin
this deadly dark? ' 'I will,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli shall walk with me. Follow my staff! t As the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps, he held his staff
aloft, and from its tip there came a faint radiance. The wide stairway was
sound and undamaged. Two hundred steps they counted, broad and shallow;
and at the top they found an arched passage with a level floor leading on into
the dark. 'Let us sit and rest and have something to eat, here on the landing,
since we can't find a dining-room! ' said Frodo. He had begun to shake off
the terror of the clutching arm, and suddenly he felt extremely hungry. The proposal was welcomed by all; and they sat down on the upper steps,
dim figures in the gloom. After they had eaten, Gandalf gave them each a
third sip of the miruvor of Rivendell. 'It will not last much longer, I am afraid,’ he said; 'but I think we
need it after that horror at the gate. And unless we have great luck, we
shall need all that is left before we see the other side! Go carefully with
the water, too! There are many streams and wells in the Mines, but they
should not be touched. We may not have a chance of filling our skins and
bottles till we come down into Dimrill Dale.' 'How long is that going to take us? ' asked Frodo. 'I cannot say,' answered Gandalf. 'It depends on many chances. But
going straight, without mishap or losing our way, we shall take three or
four marches, I expect. It cannot be less than forty miles from West -door to
East-gate in a direct line, and the road may wind much.' After only a brief rest they started on their way again. All were eager
to get the journey over as quickly as possible, and were willing, tired as
they were, to go on marching still for several hours. Gandalf walked in
front as before. In his left hand he held up his glimmering staff, the light
of which just showed the ground before his feet; in his right he held his
sword Glamdring. Behind him came Gimli, his eyes glinting in the dim light
as he turned his head from side to side. Behind the dwarf walked Frodo, and
he had drawn the short sword, Sting. No gleam came from the blades of Sting
or of Glamdring; and that was some comfort, for being the work of Elvish
smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a cold light, if any Ores
were near at hand. Behind Frodo went Sam, and after him Legolas, and the
young hobbits, and Boromir. In the dark at the rear, grim and silent, walked
Aragorn. The passage twisted round a few turns, and then began to descend. It
went steadily down for a long while before it became level once again. The
air grew hot and stifling, but it was not foul, and at times they felt
currents of cooler air upon their faces, issuing from half-guessed openings
in the walls. There were many of these. In the pale ray of the wizard's
staff, Frodo caught glimpses of stairs and arches and of other passages and
tunnels, sloping up, or running steeply down, or opening blankly dark on
either side. It was bewildering beyond hope of remembering. Gimli aided Gandalf very little, except by his stout courage. At least
he was not, as were most of the others, troubled by the mere darkness in
itself. Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was
doubtful; but it was always Gandalf who had the final word. The Mines of
Moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of Gimli, Gluin's son,
dwarf of the mountain-race though he was. To Gandalf the far-off memories of
a journey long before were now of little help, but even in the gloom and
despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did
not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal. 'Do not be afraid! ' said Aragorn. There was a pause longer than usual,
and Gandalf and Gimli were whispering together; the others were crowded
behind, waiting anxiously. 'Do not be afraid! I have been with him on many a
journey, if never on one so dark; and there are tales of Rivendell of
greater deeds of his than any that I have seen. He will not go astray-if
there is any path to find. He has led us in here against our fears, but he
will lead us out again, at whatever cost to himself. He is surer of finding
the way home in a blind night than the cats of Queen Ber®thiel.' It was well for the Company that they had such a guide. They had no
fuel nor any means of making torches; in the desperate scramble at the doors
many things had been left behind. But without any light they would soon have
come to grief. There were not only many roads to choose from, there were
also in many places holes and pitfalls, and dark wells beside the path in
which their passing feet echoed. There were fissures and chasms in the walls
and floor, and every now and then a crack would open right before their
feet. The widest was more than seven feet across, and it was long before
Pippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap. The noise
of churning water came up from far below, as if some great mill-wheel was
turning in the depths. 'Rope! ' muttered Sam. 'I knew I'd want it, if I hadn't got it! ' As these dangers became more frequent their march became slower.
Already they seemed to have been tramping on, on, endlessly to the
mountains' roots. They were more than weary, and yet there seemed no comfort
in the thought of halting anywhere. Frodo's spirits had risen for a while
after his escape, and after food and a draught of the cordial; but now a
deep uneasiness, growing to dread, crept over him again. Though he had been
healed in Rivendell of the knife-stroke, that grim wound had not been
without effect. His senses were sharper and more aware of things that could
not be seen. One sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could
see more in the dark than any of his companions, save perhaps Gandalf. And
he was in any case the bearer of the Ring: it hung upon its chain against
his breast, and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight. He felt the certainty of
evil ahead and of evil following; but he said nothing. He gripped tighter on
the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly. The Company behind him spoke seldom, and then only in hurried whispers.
There was no sound but the sound of their own feet; the dull stump of
Gimli's dwarf-boots; the heavy tread of Boromir; the light step of Legolas;
the soft, scarce-heard patter of hobbit-feet; and in the rear the slow firm
footfalls of Aragorn with his long stride. When they halted for a moment
they heard nothing at all, unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and
drip of unseen water. Yet Frodo began to hear, or to imagine that he heard,
something else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet. It was never loud
enough, or near enough, for him to feel certain that he heard it; but once
it had started it never stopped, while the Company was moving. But it was
not an echo, for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself,
and then grew still. It was after nightfall when they had entered the Mines. They had been
going for several hours with only brief halts, when Gandalf came to his
first serious check. Before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three
passages: all led in the same general direction, eastwards; but the
left-hand passage plunged down, while the right-hand climbed up, and the
middle way seemed to run on, smooth and level but very narrow. 'I have no memory of this place at all!' said Gandalf, standing
uncertainly under the arch. He held up his staff in the hope of finding some
marks or inscription that might help his choice; but nothing of the kind was
to be seen. I am too weary to decide,' he said, shaking his head. 'And I
expect that you are all as weary as I am, or wearier. We had better halt
here for what is left of the night. You know what I mean! In here it is ever
dark; but outside the late Moon is riding westward and the middle-night has
passed.' 'Poor old Bill! ' said Sam. 'I wonder where he is. I hope those wolves
haven't got him yet.' To the left of the great arch they found a stone door: it was half
closed, but swung back easily to a gentle thrust. Beyond there seemed to lie
a wide chamber cut in the rock. 'Steady! Steady! ' cried Gandalf as Merry and Pippin pushed forward,
glad to find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of
shelter than in the open passage. 'Steady! You do not know what is inside
yet. I will go first.’ He went in cautiously, and the others filed behind. 'There! ’ he said,
pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor. Before his feet they saw
a large round hole like the mouth of a well. Broken and rusty chains lay at
the edge and trailed down into the black pit. Fragments of stone lay near. 'One of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were
going to strike the bottom,' said Aragorn to Merry. 'Let the guide go first
while you have one.' 'This seems to have been a guardroom, made for the watching of the
three passages,' said Gimli. 'That hole was plainly a well for the guards'
use, covered with a stone lid. But the lid is broken, and we must all take
care in the dark.' Pippin felt curiously attracted by the well. While the others were
unrolling blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber, as far
as possible from the hole in the floor, he crept to the edge and peered
over. A chill air seemed to strike his face, rising from invisible depths.
Moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone, and let it drop. He
felt his heart beat many times before there was any sound. Then far below,
as if the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernous place, there
came a plunk , very distant, but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft. 'What's that? ' cried Gandalf. He was relieved when Pippin confessed
what he had done; but he was angry, and Pippin could see his eye glinting.
’Fool of a Took! ' he growled. 'This is a serious journey, not a hobbit
walking -party. Throw yourself in next time, and then you will be no further
nuisance. Now be quiet! ' Nothing more was heard for several minutes; but then there came out of
the depths faint knocks: tom-tap, tap-tom. They stopped, and when the echoes
had died away, they were repeated: tap-tom, tom-tap, tap-tap, tom. They
sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort; but after a while the
knocking died away and was not heard again. 'That was the sound of a hammer, or I have never heard one,' said
Gimli. 'Yes,' said Gandalf, 'and I do not like it. It may have nothing to do
with Peregrin's foolish stone; but probably something has been disturbed
that would have been better left quiet. Pray, do nothing of the kind again! Let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble. You, Pippin, can
go on the first watch, as a reward,' he growled, as he rolled himself in a
blanket. Pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark; but he kept on
turning round, fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out of the
well. He wished he could cover the hole, if only with a blanket, but he
dared not move or go near it, even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep. Actually Gandalf was awake, though lying still and silent. He was deep
in thought, trying to recall every memory of his former journey in the
Mines, and considering anxiously the next course that he should take; a
false turn now might be disastrous. After an hour he rose up and came over
to Pippin. 'Get into a corner and have a sleep, my lad,' he said in a kindly tone.
'You want to sleep, I expect. I cannot get a wink, so I may as well do the
watching.' 'I know what is the matter with me,' he muttered, as he sat down by the
door. 'I need smoke ! I have not tasted it since the morning before the
snowstorm.' The last thing that Pippin saw, as sleep took him, was a dark glimpse
of the old wizard huddled on the floor, shielding a glowing chip in his
gnarled hands between his knees. The flicker for a moment showed his sharp
nose, and the puff of smoke. It was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep. He had sat and watched
all alone for about six hours, and had let the others rest. 'And in the
watches I have made up my mind,' he said. 'I do not like the feel of the
middle way; and I do not like the smell of the left-hand way: there is foul
air down there, or I am no guide. I shall take the right-hand passage. It is
time we began to climb up again.' For eight dark hours, not counting two brief halts, they marched on;
and they met no danger, and heard nothing, and saw nothing but the faint
gleam of the wizard's light, bobbing like a will-o'-the-wisp in front of
them. The passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards. As far as they
could judge it went in great mounting curves, and as it rose it grew loftier
and wider. There were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels on
either side, and the floor was level and sound, without pits or cracks.
Evidently they had struck what once had been an important road; and they
went forward quicker than they had done on their first march. In this way they advanced some fifteen miles, measured in a direct line
east, though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more. As the
road climbed upwards' Frodo's spirits rose a little; but he still felt
oppressed, and still at times he heard, or thought he heard, away behind the
Company and beyond the fall and patter of their feet, a following footstep
that was not an echo. They had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest, and
all were thinking of a place where they could sleep, when suddenly the walls
to right and left vanished. They seemed to have passed through some arched
doorway into a black and empty space. There was a great draught of warmer
air behind them, and before them the darkness was cold on their faces. They
halted and crowded anxiously together. Gandalf seemed pleased. 'I chose the right way,' he said. 'At last we
are coming to the habitable parts, and I guess that we are not far now from
the eastern side. But we are high up, a good deal higher than the Dimrill
Gate, unless I am mistaken. From the feeling of the air we must be in a wide
hall. I will now risk a little real light.' He raised his staff, and for a brief instant there was blaze like a
flash of lightning. Great shadows sprang up and fled, and for a second they
saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of
stone. Before them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall; its black
walls, polished and smooth as glass, flashed and glittered. Three other
entrances they saw, dark black arches: one straight before them eastwards,
and one on either side. Then the light went out. 'That is all that I shall venture on for the present,' said Gandalf. 'There used to be great windows on the mountain-side, and shafts leading out
to the light in the upper reaches of the Mines. I think we have reached them
now, but it is night outside again, and we cannot tell until morning. If I
am right, tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in. But in the
meanwhile we had better go no further. Let us rest, if we can. Things have
gone well so far, and the greater part of the dark road is over. But we are
not through yet, and it is a long way down to the Gates that open on the
world.' The Company spent that night in the great cavernous hall, huddled close
together in a corner to escape the draught: there seemed to be a steady
inflow of chill air through the eastern archway. All about them as they lay
hung the darkness, hollow and immense, and they were oppressed by the
loneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs
and passages. The wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested to
the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of Moria. 'There must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time ' said
Sam; 'and every one of them busier than badgers for five hundred years to
make all this, and most in hard rock too! What did they do it all for? They
didn't live in these darksome holes surely? ' 'These are not holes,’ said Gimli. 'This is the great realm and city of
the Dwarrowdelf. And of old it was not darksome, but full of light and
splendour, as is still remembered in our songs.' He rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep voice,
while the echoes ran away into the roof. The world was young, the mountains green,
No stain yet on the Moon was seen, No words were laid on stream or stone
When Durin woke and walked alone. He named the nameless hills and dells;
He drank from yet untasted wells; He stooped and looked in Mirrormere,
And saw a crown of stars appear, As gems upon a silver thread, Above the shadow of his head. The world was fair, the mountains tall,
In Elder Days before the fall
Of mighty kings in Nargothrond
And Gondolin, who now beyond
The Western Seas have passed away:
The world was fair in Durin 's Day. A king he was on carven throne
In many-pillared halls of stone
With golden roof and silver floor, And runes of power upon the door. The light of sun and star and moon
In shining lamps of crystal hewn
Undimmed by cloud or shade of night
There shone for ever fair and bright. There hammer on the anvil smote, There chisel clove, and graver wrote;
There forged was blade, and bound was
The delver mined, the mason built.
There beryl, pearl, and opal pale, And metal wrought like fishes' mail,
Buckler and corslet, axe and sword,
And shining spears were laid in hoard. Unwearied then were Durin 's folk
Beneath the mountains music woke:
The harpers harped, the minstrels sang,
And at the gates the trumpets rang. The world is grey, the mountains old, The forge's fire is ashen-cold
No harp is wrung, no hammer falls: The darkness dwells in Durin 's halls
The shadow lies upon his tomb
In Moria, in Khazad-dym. But still the sunken stars appear
In dark and windless Mirrormere; There lies his crown in water deep, Till Durin wakes again from sleep. 'I like that! ' said Sam. V I should like to learn it. In Moria, in
Khazad-dym ! But it makes the darkness seem heavier, thinking of all those
lamps. Are there piles of jewels and gold lying about here still? ' Gimli was silent. Having sung his song he would say no more. 'Piles of jewels? ' said Gandalf. 'No. The Ores have often plundered
Moria; there is nothing left in the upper halls. And since the dwarves fled,
no one dares to seek the shafts and treasuries down in the deep places: they
are drowned in water— or in a shadow of fear.' 'Then what do the dwarves want to come back for? ’ asked Sam. ’For mithrif answered Gandalf. 'The wealth of Moria was not in gold
and jewels, the toys of the Dwarves; nor in iron, their servant. Such things
they found here, it is true, especially iron; but they did not need to delve
for them: all things that they desired they could obtain in traffic. For
here alone in the world was found Moria-silver, or true-silver as some have
called it: mithril is the Elvish name. The Dwarves have a name which they do
not tell. Its worth was ten times that of gold, and now it is beyond price;
for little is left above ground, and even the Ores dare not delve here for
it. The lodes lead away north towards Caradhras, and down to darkness. The
Dwarves tell no tale; but even as mithril was the foundation of their
wealth, so also it was their destruction: they delved too greedily and too
deep, and disturbed that from which they fled, Durin’s Bane. Of what they
brought to light the Ores have gathered nearly all, and given it in tribute
to Sauron, who covets it. ' Mithril! All folk desired it. It could be beaten like copper, and
polished like glass; and the Dwarves could make of it a metal, light and yet
harder than tempered steel. Its beauty was like to that of common silver,
but the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim. The Elves dearly
loved it, and among many uses they made of it ithildin , starmoon, which you
saw upon the doors. Bilbo had a corslet of mithril-rings that Thorin gave
him. I wonder what has become of it? Gathering dust still in Michel Delving
Mathom-house, I suppose.' 'What? ' cried Gimli, startled out of his silence. 'A corslet of
Moria- silver? That was a kingly gift! ’ 'Yes,' said Gandalf. I never told him, but its worth was greater than
the value of the whole Shire and everything in it.' Frodo said nothing, but he put his hand under his tunic and touched the
rings of his mail-shirt. He felt staggered to think that he had been walking
about with the price of the Shire under his jacket. Had Bilbo known? He felt
no doubt that Bilbo knew quite well. It was indeed a kingly gift. But now
his thoughts had been carried away from the dark Mines, to Rivendell, to
Bilbo, and to Bag End in the days while Bilbo was still there. He wished
with all his heart that he was back there, and in those days, mowing the
lawn, or pottering among the flowers, and that he had never heard of Moria,
or mithril — or the Ring. A deep silence fell. One by one the others fell asleep. Frodo was on
guard. As if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors out of deep
places, dread came over him. His hands were cold and his brow damp. He
listened. All his mind was given to listening and nothing else for two slow
hours; but he heard no sound, not even the imagined echo of a footfall. His watch was nearly over, when, far off where he guessed that the
western archway stood, he fancied that he could see two pale points of
light, almost like luminous eyes. He started. His head had nodded. 'I must
have nearly fallen asleep on guard,' he thought. 'I was on the edge of a
dream.' He stood up and rubbed his eyes, and remained standing, peering into
the dark, until he was relieved by Legolas. When he lay down he quickly went to sleep, but it seemed to him that
the dream went on: he heard whispers, and saw the two pale points of light
approaching, slowly. He woke and found that the others were speaking softly
near him, and that a dim light was falling on his face. High up above the
eastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam; and
across the hall through the northern arch light also glimmered faint and
distantly. Frodo sat up. 'Good morning! 'said Gandalf: 'For morning it is again
at last. I was right, you see. We are high up on the east side of Moria.
Before today is over we ought to find the Great Gates and see the waters of
Mirrormere lying in the Dimrill Dale before us.' 'I shall be glad,' said Gimli. 'I have looked on Moria, and it is very
great, but it has become dark and dreadful; and we have found no sign of my
kindred. I doubt now that Balin ever came here.' After they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at once. 'We
are tired, but we shall rest better when we are outside,’ he said. 'I think
that none of us will wish to spend another night in Moria.’ 'No indeed! ’ said Boromir. 'Which way shall we take? Yonder eastward
arch? ’ ’Maybe,’ said Gandalf. 'But I du not know yet exactly where we are.
Unless I am quite astray, I guess that we are above and to the north of the
Great Gates; and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them. The
eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take; but before
we make up our minds we ought to look about us. Let us go towards that light
in the north door. If we could find a window it would help, but I fear that
the light comes only down deep shafts.’ Following his lead the Company passed under the northern arch. They
found themselves in a wide corridor. As they went along it the glimmer grew
stronger, and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right. It was
high and flat-topped, and the stone door was still upon its hinges, standing
half open. Beyond it was a large square chamber. It was dimly lit, but to
their eyes, after so long a time in the dark, it seemed dazzlingly bright,
and they blinked as they entered. Their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor, and stumbled among
things lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not at first make out.
The chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the further eastern wall; it
slanted upwards and, far above, a small square patch of blue sky could be
seen. The light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the
room: a single oblong block, about two feet high, upon which was laid a
great slab of white stone. 'It looks like a tomb,’ muttered Frodo, and bent forwards with a
curious sense of foreboding, to look more closely at it. Gandalf came
quickly to his side. On the slab runes were deeply graven:
These are Daeron's Runes, such as were used of old in Moria,' said
Gandalf. 'Here is written in the tongues of Men and Dwarves:
balin son of fundin
lord of moria.' 'He is dead then,' said Frodo. T feared it was so.' Gimli cast his
hood over his face.
Chapter 5 . The Bridge of Khazad-dym The Company of the Ring stood silent beside the tomb of Balin. Frodo
thought of Bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf, and of Balin's
visit to the Shire long ago. In that dusty chamber in the mountains it
seemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of the world. At length they stirred and looked up, and began to search for anything
that would give them tidings of Balin's fate, or show what had become of his
folk. There was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber, under
the shaft. By both the doors they could now see that many bones were lying,
and among them were broken swords and axe-heads, and cloven shields and
helms. Some of the swords were crooked: ore-scimitars with blackened blades. There were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls, and in them were
large iron-bound chests of wood. All had been broken and plundered; but
beside the shattered lid of one there lay the remains of a book. It had been
slashed and stabbed and partly burned, and it was so stained with black and
other dark marks like old blood that little of it could be read. Gandalf
lifted it carefully, but the leaves crackled and broke as he laid it on the
slab. He pored over it for some time without speaking. Frodo and Gimli
standing at his side could see, as he gingerly turned the leaves, that they
were written by many different hands, in runes, both of Moria and of Dale,
and here and there in Elvish script. At last Gandalf looked up. 'It seems to be a record of the fortunes of
Balin's folk,' he said. V I guess that it began with their coming to Dimrill
Dale nigh on thirty years ago: the pages seem to have numbers referring to
the years after their arrival. The top page is marked one — three, so at
least two are missing from the beginning. Listen to this! 'We drove out ores from the great gate and guard — I think; the next
word is blurred and burned; probably room — we slew many in the bright — I
think — sun in the dale. Flui was killed by an arrow. He slew the great. Then there is a blur followed by Flui under grass near Mirror mere. The next
line or two I cannot read. Then comes We have taken the twentyfirst hall of
North end to dwell in. There is I cannot read what. A shaft is mentioned. Then Balin has set up his seat in the Chamber of Mazarbul.' 'The Chamber of Records,' said Gimli. V I guess that is where we now
stand.' 'Well, I can read no more for a long way,' said Gandalf, ’except the
word gold , and Darin 's Axe and something helm. Then Balin is now lord of
Morici. That seems to end a chapter. After some stars another hand begins,
and I can see we found truesilver, and later the word wellforged and then
something, I have it! mithril; and the last two lines Uin to seek for the
upper armouries of Third Deep, something go westwards, a blur, to Hollin
gate' Gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside. 'There are several pages of
the same sort, rather hastily written and much damaged, he said; 'but I can
make little of them in this light. Now there must be a number of leaves
missing, because they begin to be numbered five, the fifth year of the
colony, I suppose. Let me see! No, they are too cut and stained; I cannot
read them. We might do better in the sunlight. Wait! Here is something: a
large bold hand using an Elvish script.’ ’That would be Ori's hand,' said Gimli, looking over the wizard's arm. 'He could write well and speedily, and often used the Elvish characters.’ 'I fear he had ill tidings to record in a fair hand,' said Gandalf. 'The first clear word is sorrow, but the rest of the line is lost, unless it
ends in estre. Yes, it must be yestre followed by day being the tenth of
novembre Balin lord of Moria fell in Dimrill Dale. He went alone to look in
Mirror mere, an ore shot him from behind a stone, we slew the ore, hut many
more ...up from east up the Silverlode. The remainder of the page is so
blurred that I can hardly make anything out, but I think I can read we have
barred the gates, and then can hold them long if, and then perhaps horrible
and suffer. Poor Balin! He seems to have kept the title that he took for
less than five years. I wonder what happened afterwards; but there is no
time to puzzle out the last few pages. Here is the last page of all.' He
paused and sighed. 'It is grim reading,' he said. 'I fear their end was cruel. Listen! We
cannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken the Bridge and second
hall. Frbr and Luni and Nbli fell there. Then there are four lines smeared
so that I can only read went 5 days ago. The last lines run the pool is up
to the wall at Westgate. The Watcher in the Water took Uin. We cannot get
out. The end comes, and then drums, drums in the deep. I wonder what that
means. The last thing written is in a trailing scrawl of elf-letters: they
are coming. There is nothing more.' Gandalf paused and stood in silent
thought. A sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the Company. ' We
cannot get out,' muttered Gimli. 'It was well for us that the pool had sunk
a little, and that the Watcher was sleeping down at the southern end.' Gandalf raised his head and looked round. 'They seem to have made a
last stand by both doors,' he said; 'but there were not many left by that
time. So ended the attempt to retake Moria! It was valiant but foolish. The
time is not come yet. Now, I fear, we must say farewell to Balin son of
Fundin. Here he must lie in the halls of his fathers. We will take this
book, the Book of Mazarbul, and look at it more closely later. You had
better keep it, Gimli, and take it back to Dbin, if you get a chance. It
will interest him, though it will grieve him deeply. Come, let us go! The
morning is passing.' 'Which way shall we go? ' asked Boromir. 'Back to the hall,' answered Gandalf. 'But our visit to this room has
not been in vain. I now know where we are. This must be, as Gimli says, the
Chamber of Mazarbul; and the hall must be the twenty-first of the North-end.
Therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the hall, and bear right
and south, and go downwards. The Twenty-first Hall should be on the Seventh
Level, that is six above the level of the Gates. Come now! Back to the hall! f Gandalf had hardly spoken these words, when there came a great noise: a
rolling Boom that seemed to come from depths far below, and to tremble in
the stone at their feet. They sprang towards the door in alarm. Doom, doom
it rolled again, as if huge hands were turning the very caverns of Moria
into a vast drum. Then there came an echoing blast: a great horn was blown
in the hall, and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off. There was a hurrying sound of many feet. 'They are coming! ’ cried Legolas. 'We cannot get out,' said Gimli. 'Trapped! ' cried Gandalf. 'Why did I delay? Here we are, caught, just
as they were before. But I was not here then. We will see what — ' Doom, doom came the drum-beat and the walls shook. 'Slam the doors and wedge them! ' shouted Aragorn. 'And keep your packs
on as long as you can: we may get a chance to cut our way out yet.' 'No! ' said Gandalf. 'We must not get shut in. Keep the east door ajar! We will go that way, if we get a chance.'
Another harsh horn-call and shrill cries rang out. Feet were coming
down the corridor. There was a ring and clatter as the Company drew their
swords. Glamdring shone with a pale light, and Sting glinted at the edges.
Boromir set his shoulder against the western door. 'Wait a moment! Do not close it yet! ' said Gandalf. He sprang forward
to Boromir's side and drew himself up to his full height. 'Who comes hither to disturb the rest of Balin Lord of Moria? ' he
cried in a loud voice. There was a rush of hoarse laughter, like the fall of sliding stones
into a pit; amid the clamour a deep voice was raised in command. Doom,
boom, doom went the drums in the deep. With a quick movement Gandalf stepped before the narrow opening of the
door and thrust forward his staff: There was a dazzling flash that lit the
chamber and the passage outside. For an instant the wizard looked out.
Arrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back. 'There are Ores, very many of them,' he said. 'And some are large and
evil: black Uruks of Mordor. For the moment they are hanging back, but there
is something else there. A great cave-troll, I think, or more than one. There is no hope of escape that way.' 'And no hope at all, if they come at the other door as well,' said
Boromir. 'There is no sound outside here yet,' said Aragorn, who was standing by
the eastern door listening. 'The passage on this side plunges straight down
a stair: it plainly does not lead back towards the hall. But it is no good
flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behind. We cannot block the
door. Its key is gone and the lock is broken, and it opens inwards. We must
do something to delay the enemy first. We will make them fear the Chamber of
Mazarbul!’ he said grimly feeling the edge of his sword, And®ril. Heavy feet were heard in the corridor. Boromir flung himself against
the door and heaved it to; then he wedged it with broken sword-blades and
splinters of wood. The Company retreated to the other side of the chamber.
But they had no chance to fly yet. There was a blow on the door that made it
quiver; and then it began to grind slowly open, driving back the wedges. A
huge arm and shoulder, with a dark skin of greenish scales, was thrust
through the widening gap. Then a great, flat, toeless foot was forced
through below. There was a dead silence outside.
Boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his might; but his
sword rang, glanced aside, and fell from his shaken hand. The blade was
notched. Suddenly, and to his own surprise, Frodo felt a hot wrath blaze up in
his heart. 'The Shire! ' he cried, and springing beside Boromir, he stooped,
and stabbed with Sting at the hideous foot. There was a bellow, and the foot
jerked back, nearly wrenching Sting from Frodo's arm. Black drops dripped
from the blade and smoked on the floor. Boromir hurled himself against the
door and slammed it again. 'One for the Shire! ' cried Aragorn. 'The hobbit's bite is deep! You
have a good blade, Frodo son of Drogo ! ' There was a crash on the door, followed by crash after crash. Rams and
hammers were beating against it. It cracked and staggered back, and the
opening grew suddenly wide. Arrows came whistling in, but struck the
northern wall, and fell harmlessly to the floor. There was a horn-blast and
a rush of feet, and ores one after another leaped into the chamber. How many there were the Company could not count. The affray was sharp,
but the ores were dismayed by the fierceness of the defence. Legolas shot
two through the throat. Gimli hewed the legs from under another that had
sprung up on Balin' s tomb. Boromir and Aragorn slew many. When thirteen
had fallen the rest fled shrieking, leaving the defenders unharmed, except for
Sam who had a scratch along the scalp. A quick duck had saved him; and he
had felled his ore: a sturdy thrust with his Barrow-blade. A fire was
smouldering in his brown eyes that would have made Ted Sandyman step
backwards, if he had seen it. 'Now is the time! ' cried Gandalf. 'Let us go, before the troll
returns!' But even as they retreated, and before Pippin and Merry had reached the
stair outside, a huge ore-chieftain, almost man-high, clad in black mail
from head to foot, leaped into the chamber; behind him his followers
clustered in the doorway. His broad flat face was swart, his eyes were like
coals, and his tongue was red; he wielded a great spear. With a thrust of
his huge hide shield he turned Boromir's sword and bore him backwards,
throwing him to the ground. Diving under Aragorn's blow with the speed of a
striking snake he charged into the Company and thrust with his spear
straight at Frodo. The blow caught him on the right side, and Frodo was
hurled against the wall and pinned. Sam, with a cry, hacked at the
spear- shaft, and it broke. But even as the ore flung down the truncheon and
swept out his scimitar, And®ril came down upon his helm. There was a flash
like flame and the helm burst asunder. The ore fell with cloven head. His
followers fled howling, as Boromir and Aragorn sprang at them. Doom, doom went the drums in the deep. The great voice rolled out
again. 'Now! ' shouted Gandalf. 'Now is the last chance. Run for it! ' Aragorn picked up Frodo where he lay by the wall and made for the
stair, pushing Merry and Pippin in front of him. The others followed; but
Gimli had to be dragged away by Legolas: in spite of the peril he lingered
by Balin's tomb with his head bowed. Boromir hauled the eastern door to,
grinding upon its hinges: it had great iron rings on either side, but could
not be fastened. 'I am all right,' gasped Frodo. 'I can walk. Put me down! ' Aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement. 'I thought you were dead! ' he cried. 'Not yet! ' said Gandalf. 'But there is time for wonder. Off you go,
all of you, down the stairs! Wait a few minutes for me at the bottom, but if
I do not come soon, go on! Go quickly and choose paths leading right and
downwards.' 'We cannot leave you to hold the door alone! ' said Aragorn. 'Do as I say! ' said Gandalf fiercely. 'Swords are no more use here. Go!' The passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark. They groped their
way down a long flight of steps, and then looked back; but they could see
nothing, except high above them the faint glimmer of the wizard's staff. He
seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed door. Frodo breathed
heavily and leaned against Sam, who put his arms about him. They stood
peering up the stairs into the darkness. Frodo thought he could hear the
voice of Gandalf above, muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with
a sighing echo. He could not catch what was said. The walls seemed to be
trembling. Every now and again the drum-beats throbbed and rolled: doom,
doom. Suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light. Then
there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud. The drum-beats broke out wildly:
doom-boom, doom-boom, and then stopped. Gandalf came flying down the
steps and fell to the ground in the midst of the Company. 'Well, well! That's over! ' said the wizard struggling to his feet. 'I
have done all that I could. But I have met my match, and have nearly been
destroyed. But don't stand here! Go on! You will have to do without light
for a while: I am rather shaken. Go on! Go on! Where are you, Gimli? Come
ahead with me! Keep close behind, all of you!' They stumbled after him wondering what had happened. Doom, doom
went the drum-beats again: they now sounded muffled and far away, but they were
following. There was no other sound of pursuit, neither tramp of feet, nor
any voice. Gandalf took no turns, right or left, for the passage seemed to
be going in the direction that he desired. Every now and again it descended
a flight of steps, fifty or more, to a lower level. At the moment that was
their chief danger; for in the dark they could not see a descent, until they
came on it, and put their feet out into emptiness. Gandalf felt the ground
with his staff like a blind man. At the end of an hour they had gone a mile, or maybe a little more, and
had descended many flights of stairs. There was still no sound of pursuit.
Almost they began to hope that they would escape. At the bottom of the
seventh flight Gandalf halted. 'It is getting hot! ' he gasped. 'We ought to be down at least to the
level of the Gates now. Soon I think we should look for a left-hand turn to
take us east. I hope it is not far. I am very weary. I must rest here a
moment, even if all the ores ever spawned are after us.' Gimli took his arm and helped him down to a seat on the step. 'What
happened away up there at the door? ’ he asked. 'Did you meet the beater of
the drums? ’ ’I do not know,' answered Gandalf. 'But I found myself suddenly faced
by something that I have not met before. I could think of nothing to do but
to try and put a shutting -spell on the door. I know many; but to do things
of that kind rightly requires time, and even then the door can be broken by
strength. 'As I stood there I could hear ore- voices on the other side: at any
moment I thought they would burst it open. I could not hear what was said;
they seemed to be talking in their own hideous language. All I caught was
ghvsh; that is "fire". Then something came into the chamber — I felt it
through the door, and the ores themselves were afraid and fell silent. It
laid hold of the iron ring, and then it perceived me and my spell. ’What it was I cannot guess, but I have never felt such a challenge. The counter-spell was terrible. It nearly broke me. For an instant the door
left my control and began to open ! I had to speak a word of Command. That
proved too great a strain. The door burst in pieces. Something dark as a
cloud was blocking out all the light inside, and I was thrown backwards down
the stairs. All the wall gave way, and the roof of the chamber as well, I
think. 'I am afraid Balin is buried deep, and maybe something else is buried
there too. I cannot say. But at least the passage behind us was completely
blocked. Ah! I have never felt so spent, but it is passing. And now what
about you, Frodo? There was not time to say so, but I have never been more
delighted in my life than when you spoke. I feared that it was a brave but
dead hobbit that Aragorn was carrying.’ 'What about me? ' said Frodo. 'I am alive, and whole I think. I am
bruised and in pain, but it is not too bad.’ 'Well,' said Aragorn, 'I can only say that hobbits are made of a stuff
so tough that I have never met the like of it. Had I known, I would have
spoken softer in the Inn at Bree! That spear -thrust would have skewered a
wild boar! ’ ’Well, it did not skewer me, I am glad to say,’ said Frodo; 'though I
feel as if I had been caught between a hammer and an anvil.’ He said no
more. He found breathing painful. ’You take after Bilbo,’ said Gandalf. 'There is more about you than
meets the eye, as I said of him long ago.’ Frodo wondered if the remark
meant more than it said. They now went on again. Before long Gimli spoke. He had keen eyes in
the dark. 'I think,’ he said, 'that there is a light ahead. But it is not
daylight. It is red. What can it be? ’ ' Ghvsh !' muttered Gandalf. 'I wonder if that is what they meant: that
the lower levels are on fire? Still, we can only go on.’ Soon the light became unmistakable, and could be seen by all. It was
flickering and glowing on the walls away down the passage before them. They
could now see their way: in front the road sloped down swiftly, and some way
ahead there stood a low archway; through it the glowing light came. The air
became very hot. When they came to the arch Gandalf went through, signing to them to
wait. As he stood just beyond the opening they saw his face lit by a red
glow. Quickly he stepped back. 'There is some new devilry here,' he said, 'devised for our welcome no
doubt. But I know now where we are: we have reached the First Deep, the
level immediately below the Gates. This is the Second Hall of Old Moria; and
the Gates are near: away beyond the eastern end, on the left, not more than
a quarter of a mile. Across the Bridge, up a broad stair, along a wide road
through the First Hall, and out! But come and look! ' They peered out. Before them was another cavernous hall. It was loftier
and far longer than the one in which they had slept. They were near its
eastern end; westward it ran away into darkness. Down the centre stalked a
double line of towering pillars. They were carved like boles of mighty trees
whose boughs upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone. Their stems
were smooth and black, but a red glow was darkly mirrored in their sides.
Right across the floor, close to the feet of two huge pillars a great
fissure had opened. Out of it a fierce red light came, and now and again
flames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns. Wisps
of dark smoke wavered in the hot air. 'If we had come by the main road down from the upper halls, we should
have been trapped here,' said Gandalf. 'Let us hope that the fire now lies
between us and pursuit. Come! There is no time to lose.' Even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum-beat: Doom, doom,
doom. Away beyond the shadows at the western end of the hall there came
cries and horn-calls. Doom, doom : the pillars seemed to tremble and the
flames to quiver. 'Now for the last race! ’ said Gandalf. 'If the sun is shining outside
we may still escape. After me! ' He turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall. The
distance was greater than it had looked. As they ran they heard the beat and
echo of many hurrying feet behind. A shrill yell went up: they had been
seen. There was a ring and clash of steel. An arrow whistled over Frodo's
head. Boromir laughed. 'They did not expect this,’ he said. 'The fire has cut
them off. We are on the wrong side! ’ 'Look ahead! ' called Gandalf. 'The Bridge is near. It is dangerous and
narrow.’ Suddenly Frodo saw before him a black chasm. At the end of the hall the
floor vanished and fell to an unknown depth. The outer door could only be
reached by a slender bridge of stone, without kerb or rail, that spanned the
chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet. It was an ancient defence of
the Dwarves against any enemy that might capture the First Hall and the
outer passages. They could only pass across it in single file. At the brink
Gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind. 'Lead the way, Gimli! ' he said. 'Pippin and Merry next. Straight on
and up the stair beyond the door! ' Arrows fell among them. One struck Frodo and sprang back. Another
pierced Gandalf s hat and stuck there like a black feather. Frodo looked
behind. Beyond the fire he saw swarming black figures: there seemed to be
hundreds of ores. They brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as
blood in the firelight. Doom, doom rolled the drum-beats, growing louder and
louder, doom, doom. Legolas turned and set an arrow to the string, though it was a long
shot for his small bow. He drew, but his hand fell, and the arrow slipped to
the ground. He gave a cry of dismay and fear. Two great trolls appeared;
they bore great slabs of stone, and flung them down to serve as gangways
over the fire. But it was not the trolls that had filled the Elf with
terror. The ranks of the ores had opened, and they crowded away, as if they
themselves were afraid. Something was coming up behind them. What it was
could not be seen: it was like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a
dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater; and a power and terror seemed to
be in it and to go before it. It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had
bent over it. Then with a rush it leaped across the fissure. The flames
roared up to greet it, and wreathed about it; and a black smoke swirled in
the air. Its streaming mane kindled, and blazed behind it. In its right hand
was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it held a whip of
many thongs. 'Ai! ai! ' wailed Legolas. 'A Balrog! A Balrog is come! ' Gimli stared with wide eyes. 'Durin's Bane! ' he cried, and letting his
axe fall he covered his face. 'A Balrog,' muttered Gandalf. 'Now I understand.' He faltered and
leaned heavily on his staff. 'What an evil fortune! And I am already weary.'
The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them. The ores yelled
and poured over the stone gangways. Then Boromir raised his horn and blew.
Loud the challenge rang and bellowed, like the shout of many throats under
the cavernous roof. For a moment the ores quailed and the fiery shadow
halted. Then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark
wind, and the enemy advanced again. 'Over the bridge!' cried Gandalf, recalling his strength. "Fly ! This is
a foe beyond any of you. I must hold the narrow way. Fly! ' Aragorn and
Boromir did not heed the command, but still held their ground, side by side,
behind Gandalf at the far end of the bridge. The others halted just within
the doorway at the hall's end, and turned, unable to leave their leader to
face the enemy alone. The Balrog reached the bridge. Gandalf stood in the middle of the span,
leaning on the staff in his left hand, but in his other hand Glamdring
gleamed, cold and white. His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow
about it reached out like two vast wings. It raised the whip, and the thongs
whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm. 'You cannot pass,' he said. The ores stood still, and a dead silence
fell. V I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You
cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udyn. Go back to the
Shadow! You cannot pass.' The Balrog made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, but the
darkness grew. It stepped forward slowly on to the bridge, and suddenly it
drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to
wall; but still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed
small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the
onset of a storm. From out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming. Glamdring glittered white in answer. There was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. The Balrog fell
back and its sword flew up in molten fragments. The wizard swayed on the
bridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood still. 'You cannot pass! ' he said. With a bound the Balrog leaped full upon the bridge. Its whip whirled
and hissed. 'He cannot stand alone! ' cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back along the
bridge. 'Elendil!' he shouted. 'I am with you, Gandalf! '
'Gondor! ' cried Boromir and leaped after him. At that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the
bridge before him. The staff broke asunder and fell from his hand. A
blinding sheet of white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked. Right at the
Balrog's feet it broke, and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the
gulf, while the rest remained, poised, quivering like a tongue of rock
thrust out into emptiness. With a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward, and its shadow plunged
down and vanished. But even as it fell it swung its whip, and the thongs
lashed and curled about the wizard’s knees, dragging him to the brink. He
staggered and fell, grasped vainly at the stone, and slid into the abyss. ’Fly, you fools! ' he cried, and was gone. The fires went out, and blank darkness fell. The Company stood rooted
with horror staring into the pit. Even as Aragorn and Boromir came flying
back, the rest of the bridge cracked and fell. With a cry Aragorn roused
them. ’Come! I will lead you now ! ' he called. 'We must obey his last
command. Follow me! ' They stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door. Aragorn
leading, Boromir at the rear. At the top was a wide echoing passage. Along
this they fled. Frodo heard Sam at his side weeping, and then he found that
he himself was weeping as he ran. Doom, doom, doom the drum-beats rolled
behind, mournful now and slow; doom! They ran on. The light grew before them; great shafts pierced the roof. They ran swifter. They passed into a hall, bright with daylight from its
high windows in the east. They fled across it. Through its huge broken doors
they passed, and suddenly before them the Great Gates opened, an arch of
blazing light. There was a guard of ores crouching in the shadows behind the great
door posts towering on either side, but the gates were shattered and cast
down. Aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in his path, and
the rest fled in terror of his wrath. The Company swept past them and took
no heed of them. Out of the Gates they ran and sprang down the huge and
age-worn steps, the threshold of Moria. Thus, at last, they came beyond hope under the sky and felt the wind on
their faces. They did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the walls.
Dimrill Dale lay about them. The shadow of the Misty Mountains lay upon it,
but eastwards there was a golden light on the land. It was but one hour
after noon. The sun was shining; the clouds were white and high. They looked back. Dark yawned the archway of the Gates under the
mountain-shadow. Faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum-beats:
doom. A thin black smoke trailed out. Nothing else was to be seen; the dale
all around was empty. Doom. Grief at last wholly overcame them, and they
wept long: some standing and silent, some cast upon the ground. Doom, doom.
The drum-beats faded.
Chapter 6 . Lothlurien 'Alas! I Fear we cannot stay here longer,' said Aragorn. He looked
towards the mountains and held up his sword. 'Farewell, Gandalf ! ' he cried.
'Did I not say to you: if you pass the doors of Moria, bewarel Alas that I
spoke true! What hope have we without you? ' He turned to the Company. 'We must do without hope,' he said. 'At least
we may yet be avenged. Let us gird ourselves and weep no more! Come! We
have a long road, and much to do.' They rose and looked about them. Northward the dale ran up into a glen
of shadows between two great arms of the mountains, above which three white
peaks were shining: Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Caradhras. the Mountains of Moria.
At the head of the glen a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless
ladder of short falls, and a mist of foam hung in the air about the
mountains' feet. 'Yonder is the Dimrill Stair,' said Aragorn, pointing to the falls. 'Down the deep-cloven way that climbs beside the torrent we should have
come, if fortune had been kinder.' 'Or Caradhras less cruel,' said Gimli. 'There he stands smiling in the
sun! ' He shook his fist at the furthest of the snow-capped peaks and turned
away. To the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end,
and far lands could be descried beyond them, wide and vague. To the south
the Misty Mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach. Less than
a mile away, and a little below them, for they still stood high up on the
west side of the dale, there lay a mere. It was long and oval, shaped like a
great spear-head thrust deep into the northern glen; but its southern end
was beyond the shadows under the sunlit sky. Yet its waters were dark: a
deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamp-lit room. Its face was
still and unruffled. About it lay a smooth sward, shelving down on all sides
to its bare unbroken rim. 'There lies the Mirrormere, deep Kheled-zvram! ' said Gimli sadly. 'I
remember that he said: "May you have joy of the sight! But we cannot linger
there." Now long shall I journey ere I have joy again. It is I that must
hasten away, and he that must remain.' The Company now went down the road from the Gates. It was rough and
broken, fading to a winding track between heather and whin that thrust amid
the cracking stones. But still it could be seen that once long ago a great
paved way had wound upwards from the lowlands of the Dwarf-kingdom. In places there were ruined works of stone beside the path, and mounds of green
topped with slender birches, or fir-trees sighing in the wind. An eastward
bend led them hard by the sward of Mirrormere, and there not far from the
roadside stood a single column broken at the top. 'That is Durin's Stone! ' cried Gimli. 'I cannot pass without turning
aside for a moment to look at the wonder of the dale ! ' 'Be swift then! ' said Aragorn, looking back towards the Gates. 'The
Sun sinks early. The Ores will not, maybe, come out till after dusk, but we
must be far away before nightfall. The Moon is almost spent, and it will be
dark tonight.' 'Come with me, Frodo! ' cried the dwarf, springing from the road. 'I
would not have you go without seeing Kheled-zvram.' He ran down the long
green slope. Frodo followed slowly, drawn by the still blue water in spite
of hurt and weariness; Sam came up behind. Beside the standing stone Gimli halted and looked up. It was cracked
and weather-worn, and the faint runes upon its side could not be read. 'This
pillar marks the spot where Durin first looked in the Mirrormere,' said the
dwarf. 'Let us look ourselves once, ere we go!' They stooped over the dark water. At first they could see nothing. Then
slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profound
blue, and the peaks were like plumes of white flame above them; beyond there
was a space of sky. There like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars,
though sunlight was in the sky above. Of their own stooping forms no shadow
could be seen. 'O Kheled-zvram fair and wonderful! ' said Gimli. 'There lies the Crown
of Durin till he wakes. Farewell! ' He bowed, and turned away, and hastened
back up the green-sward to the road again. 'What did you see? ' said Pippin to Sam, but Sam was too deep in
thought to answer. The road now turned south and went quickly downwards, running out from
between the arms of the dale. Some way below the mere they came on a deep
well of water, clear as crystal, from which a freshet fell over a stone lip
and ran glistening and gurgling down a steep rocky channel. 'Here is the spring from which the Silverlode rises.' said Gimli. 'Do
not drink of it! It is icy cold.' 'Soon it becomes a swift river, and it gathers water from many other
mountain- streams,' said Aragorn. 'Our road leads beside it for many miles.
For I shall take you by the road that Gandalf chose, and first I hope to
come to the woods where the Silverlode flows into the Great River-out
yonder.' They looked as he pointed, and before them they could see the
stream leaping down to the trough of the valley, and then running on and
away into the lower lands, until it was lost in a golden haze. 'There lie the woods of Lothlurien! ’ said Legolas. 'That is the
fairest of all the dwellings of my people. There are no trees like the trees
of that land. For in the autumn their leaves fall not, but turn to gold. Not
till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall, and then the
boughs are laden with yellow flowers; and the floor of the wood is golden,
and golden is the roof, and its pillars are of silver, for the bark of the
trees is smooth and grey. So still our songs in Mirkwood say. My heart would
be glad if I were beneath the eaves of that wood, and it were springtime ! ’ 'My heart will be glad, even in the winter,' said Aragorn. 'But it lies
many miles away. Let us hasten! ' For some time Frodo and Sam managed to keep up with the others; but
Aragorn was leading them at a great pace, and after a while they lagged
behind. They had eaten nothing since the early morning. Sam's cut was
burning like fire, and his head felt light. In spite of the shining sun the
wind seemed chill after the warm darkness of Moria. He shivered. Frodo felt
every step more painful and he gasped for breath. At last Legolas turned, and seeing them now far behind, he spoke to
Aragorn. The others halted, and Aragorn ran back, calling to Boromir to come
with him. 'I am sorry, Frodo! ' he cried, full of concern. 'So much has happened
this day and we have such need of haste, that I have forgotten that you were
hurt; and Sam too. You should have spoken. We have done nothing to ease
you, as we ought, though all the ores of Moria were after us. Come now! A little
further on there is a place where we can rest for a little. There I will do
what I can for you. Come, Boromir! We will carry them.'
Soon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down from the
west, and joined its bubbling water with the hurrying Silverlode. Together
they plunged over a fall of green-hued stone, and foamed down into a dell.
About it stood fir-trees, short and bent, and its sides were steep and
clothed with harts-tongue and shrubs of whortle -berry. At the bottom there
was a level space through which the stream flowed noisily over shining
pebbles. Here they rested. It was now nearly three hours after noon, and
they had come only a few miles from the Gates. Already the sun was
westering. While Gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush- and
fir-wood, and drew water, Aragorn tended Sam and Frodo. Sam's wound was
not deep, but it looked ugly, and Aragorn’s face was grave as he examined it.
After a moment he looked up with relief. ’Good luck, Sam! ’ he said. 'Many have received worse than this in
payment for the slaying of their first ore. The cut is not poisoned, as the
wounds of ore-blades too often are. It should heal well when I have tended
it. Bathe it when Gimli has heated water.' He opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves. 'They are dry
and some of their virtue has one, he said, but here I have still some of the
leaves of athelas that I gathered near Weathertop. Crush one in the water,
and wash the wound clean, and I will bind it. Now it is your turn. Frodo! ' 'I am all right,' said Frodo, reluctant to have his garments touched. 'All I needed was some food and a little rest.' 'No! ' said Aragorn. 'We must have a look and see what the hammer and
the anvil have done to you. I still marvel that you are alive at all.’ Gently he stripped off Frodo's old jacket and worn tunic, and gave a gasp of
wonder. Then he laughed. The silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like
the light upon a rippling sea. Carefully he took it off and held it up, and
the gems on it glittered like stars, and the sound of the shaken rings was
like the tinkle of rain in a pool. 'Look, my friends!’ he called. 'Here's a pretty hobbit-skin to wrap an
el ven -princeling in! If it were known that hobbits had such hides, all the
hunters of Middle-earth would be riding to the Shire.' 'And all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would be in vain,'
said Gimli, gazing at the mail in wonder. 'It is a mithril-coat. Mithril! I
have never seen or heard tell of one so fair. Is this the coat that Gandalf
spoke of? Then he undervalued it. But it was well given! ' 'I have often wondered what you and Bilbo were doing, so close in his
little room,' said Merry. 'Bless the old hobbit! I love him more than ever. I hope we get a chance of telling him about it! ' There was a dark and blackened bruise on Frodo's right side and breast.
Under the mail there was a shirt of soft leather, but at one point the rings
had been driven through it into the flesh. Frodo's left side also was scored
and bruised where he had been hurled against the wall. While the others set
the food ready. Aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was
steeped. The pungent fragrance filled the dell, and all those who stooped
over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened. Soon Frodo felt the
pain leave him, and his breath grew easy: though he was stiff and sore to
the touch for many days. Aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side. 'The mail is marvellously light,' he said. 'Put it on again, if you can
bear it. My heart is glad to know that you have such a coat. Do not lay it
aside, even in sleep, unless fortune brings you where you are safe for a
while; and that will seldom chance while your quest lasts.’ When they had eaten, the Company got ready to go on. They put out the
fire and hid all traces of it. Then climbing out of the dell they took to
the road again. They had not gone far before the sun sank behind the
westward heights and great shadows crept down the mountain-sides. Dusk
veiled their feet, and mist rose in the hollows. Away in the east the
evening light lay pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and wood. Sam and
Frodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were able to go at a fair
pace, and with only one brief halt Aragorn led the Company on for nearly
three more hours. It was dark. Deep night had fallen. There were many clear stars, hut
the fast- waning moon would not be seen till late. Gimli and Frodo were at
the rear, walking softly and not speaking, listening for any sound upon the
road behind. At length Gimli broke the silence. 'Not a sound but the wind,' he said. 'There are no goblins near, or my
ears are made of wood. It is to be hoped that the Ores will be content with
driving us from Moria. And maybe that was all their purpose, and they had
nothing else to do with us-with the Ring. Though Ores will often pursue foes
for many leagues into the plain, if they have a fallen captain to avenge.’ Frodo did not answer. He looked at Sting, and the blade was dull. Yet
he had heard something, or thought he had. As soon as the shadows had fallen
about them and the road behind was dim, he had heard again the quick patter
of feet. Even now he heard it. He turned swiftly. There were two tiny gleams
of light behind, or for a moment he thought he saw them, but at once they
slipped aside and vanished. 'What is it? ' said the dwarf. 'I don't know.' answered Frodo. 'I thought I heard feet, and I thought
I saw a light-like eyes. I have thought so often, since we first entered
Moria.' Gimli halted and stooped to the ground. 'I hear nothing but the
night-speech of plant and stone,' he said. 'Come! Let us hurry! The others
are out of sight.' The night-wind blew chill up the valley to meet them. Before them a
wide grey shadow loomed, and they heard an endless rustle of leaves like
poplars in the breeze. 'Lothlurien! ' cried Legolas. 'Lothlurien! We have come to the eaves of
the Golden Wood. Alas that it is winter! ' Under the night the trees stood tall before them, arched over the road
and stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs. In the dim
light of the stars their stems were grey, and their quivering leaves a hint
of fallow gold. 'Lothlurien! ' said Aragorn. 'Glad I am to hear again the wind in the
trees! We are still little more than five leagues from the Gates, but we can
go no further. Here let us hope that the virtue of the Elves will keep us
tonight from the peril that comes behind.' 'If Elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world,' said Gimli. 'It is long since any of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land
whence we wandered in ages long ago,' said Legolas, 'but we hear that Lurien
is not yet deserted, for there is a secret power here that holds evil from
the land. Nevertheless its folk are seldom seen, and maybe they dwell now
deep in the woods and far from the northern border.' 'Indeed deep in the wood they dwell,' said Aragorn, and sighed as if
some memory stirred in him. 'We must fend for ourselves tonight. We will go
forward a short way, until the trees are all about us, and then we will turn
aside from the path and seek a place to rest in.' He stepped forward; but Boromir stood irresolute and did not follow. 'Is there no other way? ' he said. 'What other fairer way would you desire? ’ said Aragorn.
'A plain road, though it led through a hedge of swords,' said Boromir. 'By strange paths has this Company been led, and so far to evil fortune.
Against my will we passed under the shades of Moria, to our loss. And now we
must enter the Golden Wood, you say. But of that perilous land we have heard
in Gondor, and it is said that few come out who once go in; and of that few
none have escaped unscathed.' 'Say not unscathed, but if you say unchanged, then maybe you will speak
the truth said Aragorn. But lore wanes in Gondor, Boromir, if in the city of
those who once were wise they now speak evil of Lothlurien. Believe what you
will, there is no other way for us — unless you would go back to
Moria-gate, or scale the pathless mountains, or swim the Great River all
alone.’ 'Then lead on! ' said Boromir. 'But it is perilous.’ 'Perilous indeed,' said Aragorn, 'fair and perilous; but only evil need
fear it, or those who bring some evil with them. Follow me! ' They had gone little more than a mile into the forest when they came
upon another stream flowing down swiftly from the tree-clad slopes that
climbed back westward towards the mountains. They heard it splashing over a
fall away among the shadows on their right. Its dark hurrying waters ran
across the path before them, and joined the Silverlode in a swirl of dim
pools among the roots of trees. 'Here is Nimrodel! ' said Legolas. 'Of this stream the Silvan Elves
made many songs long ago, and still we sing them in the North, remembering
the rainbow on its falls, and the golden flowers that floated in its foam. All is dark now and the Bridge of Nimrodel is broken down. I will bathe my
feet, for it is said that the water is healing to the weary.' He went
forward and climbed down the deep-cloven bank and stepped into the stream. 'Follow me!’ he cried. 'The water is not deep. Let us wade across! On
the further bank we can rest, and the sound of the falling water may bring
us sleep and forgetfulness of grief.' One by one they climbed down and followed Legolas. For a moment Frodo
stood near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feet. It was cold
but its touch was clean, and as he went on and it mounted to his knees, he
felt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs. When all the Company had crossed, they sat and rested and ate a little
food; and Legolas told them tales of Lothlurien that the Elves of Mirkwood
still kept in their hearts, of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by
the Great River before the world was grey. At length a silence fell, and they heard the music of the waterfall
running sweetly in the shadows. Almost Frodo fancied that he could hear a
voice singing, mingled with the sound of the water. 'Do you hear the voice of Nimrodel? ' asked Legolas. 'I will sing you a
song of the maiden Nimrodel, who bore the same name as the stream beside
which she lived lung ago. It is a fair song in our woodland tongue; but this
is how it runs in the Westron Speech, as some in Rivendell now sing it.' In
a soft voice hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves above them he
began: An Elven-maid there was of old, A shining star by day: Her mantle white was hemmed with gold, Her shoes of silver-grey. A star was bound upon her brows, A light was on her hair
As sun upon the golden boughs
In Lurien the fair. Her hair was long, her limbs were white, And fair she was and free; And in the wind she went as light
As leaf of linden-tree. Beside the falls of Nimrodel, By water clear and cool, Her voice as falling silver fell
Into the shining pool. Where now she wanders none can tell, In sunlight or in shade; For lost of yore was Nimrodel
And in the mountains strayed. The elven-ship in haven grey
Beneath the mountain-lee
Awaited her for many a day
Beside the roaring sea. A wind by night in Northern lands
Arose, and loud it cried, And drove the ship from elven-strands
Across the streaming tide. When dawn came dim the land was lost,
The mountains sinking grey
Beyond the heaving waves that tossed
Their plumes of blinding spray. Amroth beheld the fading shore
Now low beyond the swell, And cursed the faithless ship that bore
Him far from Nimrodel. Of old he was an Elven-king, A lord of tree and glen, When golden were the boughs in spring
In fair Lothlurien. From helm to sea they saw him leap, As arrow from the string, And dive into the water deep, As mew upon the wing. The wind was in his flowing hair, The foam about him shone; Afar they saw him strong and fair
Go riding like a swan. But from the West has come no word,
And on the Hither Shore
No tidings Elven-folk have heard
Of Amroth evermore.
The voice of Legolas faltered, and the song ceased. 'I cannot sing any
more,' he said. 'That is but a part, for I have forgotten much. It is long
and sad, for it tells how sorrow came upon Lothlurien, Lurien of the
Blossom, when the Dwarves awakened evil in the mountains.' 'But the Dwarves did not make the evil,' said Gimli. 'I said not so; yet evil came,' answered Legolas sadly. 'Then many of
the Elves of Nimrodel's kindred left their dwellings and departed and she
was lost far in the South, in the passes of the White Mountains; and she
came not to the ship where Amroth her lover waited for her. But in the
spring when the wind is in the new leaves the echo of her voice may still be
heard by the falls that bear her name. And when the wind is in the South the
voice of Amroth comes up from the sea; for Nimrodel flows into Silverlode,
that Elves call Celebrant, and Celebrant into Anduin the Great, and Anduin
flows into the Bay of B elf alas whence the Elves of Lurien set sail. But
neither Nimrodel nor Amroth ever came back. 'It is told that she had a house built in the branches of a tree that
grew near the falls; for that was the custom of the Elves of Lurien, to
dwell in the trees, and maybe it is so still. Therefore they were called the
Galadhrim, the Tree -people. Deep in their forest the trees are very great. The people of the woods did not delve in the ground like Dwarves, nor build
strong places of stone before the Shadow came.' 'And even in these latter days dwelling in the trees might be thought
safer than sitting on the ground,' said Gimli. He looked across the stream
to the road that led back to Dimrill Dale, and then up into the roof of dark
boughs above. 'Your words bring good counsel, Gimli,' said Aragorn. 'We cannot build
a house, but tonight we will do as the Galadhrim and seek refuge in the
tree-tops, if we can. We have sat here beside the road already longer than
was wise.’ The Company now turned aside from the path, and went into the shadow of
the deeper woods, westward along the mountain-stream away from
Silverlode. Not far from the falls of Nimrodel they found a cluster of trees, some of
which overhung the stream. Their great grey trunks were of mighty girth, but
their height could not be guessed. 'I will climb up,’ said Legolas. 'I am at home among trees, by root or
bough, though these trees are of a kind strange to me, save as a name in
song. Mellyrn they are called, and are those that bear the yellow blossom,
but I have never climbed in one. I will see now what is their shape and way
of growth.' 'Whatever it may be,' said Pippin, 'they will be marvellous trees
indeed if they can offer any rest at night, except to birds. I cannot sleep
on a perch ! ’ 'Then dig a hole in the ground,' said Legolas, 'if that is more after
the fashion of your kind. But you must dig swift and deep, if you wish to
hide from Ores.’ He sprang lightly up from the ground and caught a branch
that grew from the trunk high above his head. But even as he swung there for
a moment, a voice spoke suddenly from the tree-shadows above him. ' Daro !' it said in commanding tone, and Legolas dropped back to earth
in surprise and fear. He shrank against the bole of the tree. 'Stand still! ' he whispered to the others. 'Do not move or speak! ’ There was a sound of soft laughter over their heads, and then another
clear voice spoke in an elven-tongue. Frodo could understand little of what
was said, for the speech that the Silvan folk east of the mountains used
among themselves was unlike that of the West. Legolas looked up and
answered in the same language.* 'Who are they, and what do they say? ’ asked Merry. 'They're Elves,' said Sam. 'Can't you hear their voices? ' 'Yes, they are Elves,' said Legolas; 'and they say that you breathe so
loud that they could shoot you in the dark.' Sam hastily put his hand over
his mouth. 'But they say also that you need have no fear. They have been
aware of us for a long while. They heard my voice across the Nimrodel, and
knew that I was one of their Northern kindred, and therefore they did not
hinder our crossing; and afterwards they heard my song. Now they bid me
climb up with Frodo; for they seem to have had some tidings of him and of
our journey. The others they ask to wait a little and to keep watch at the
foot of the tree, until they have decided what is to be done.' Out of the shadows a ladder was let down: it was made of rope,
silver-grey and glimmering in the dark, and though it looked slender it
proved strong enough to bear many men. Legolas ran lightly up, and Frodo
followed slowly; behind came Sam trying not to breathe loudly. The branches
of the mallorn-tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk, and then swept
upward; but near the top the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs,
and among these they found that there had been built a wooden platform, or
flet as such things were called in those days: the Elves called it a talan. It was reached by a round hole in the centre through which the ladder
passed. When Frodo came at last up on to the flet he found Legolas seated with
three other Elves. They were clad in shadowy-grey, and could not be seen
among the tree-stems, unless they moved suddenly. They stood up, and one of
them uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam. He held it
up, looking at Frodo's face, and Sam's. Then he shut off the light again,
and spoke words of welcome in his elven-tongue. Frodo spoke haltingly in
return. 'Welcome!' the Elf then said again in the Common Fanguage, speaking
slowly. 'We seldom use any tongue but our own; for we dwell now in the heart
of the forest, and do not willingly have dealings with any other folk. Even
our own kindred in the North are sundered from us. But there are some of us
still who go abroad for the gathering of news and the watching of our
enemies, and they speak the languages of other lands. I am one. Haldir is my
name. My brothers, R®mil and Orophin, speak little of your tongue. 'But we have heard rumours of your coming, for the messengers of Elrond
passed by Furien on their way home up the Dimrill Stair. We had not heard of
hobbits, or halflings, for many a long year, and did not know that any yet
dwelt in Middle-earth. You do not look evil! And since you come with an Elf
of our kindred, we are willing to befriend you, as Elrond asked; though it
is not our custom to lead strangers through our land. But you must stay here
tonight. How many are you? ’ 'Eight,' said Legolas. 'Myself, four hobbits; and two men, one of whom,
Aragorn, is an Elf-friend of the folk of Westernesse.' 'The name of Aragorn son of Arathorn is known in Lurien,' said Haldir,
'and he has the favour of the Lady. All then is well. But you have yet
spoken only of seven.' 'The eighth is a dwarf,' said Legolas. 'A dwarf! ’ said Haldir. 'That is not well. We have not had dealings
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days. They are not permitted in our land. I
cannot allow him to pass.' 'But he is from the Lonely Mountain, one of Dbin's trusty people, and
friendly to Elrond,' said Frodo. 'Elrond himself chose him to be one of our
companions, and he has been brave and faithful.'
The Elves spoke together in soft voices, and questioned Legolas in
their own tongue. 'Very good,' said Haldir at last. 'We will do this, though
it is against our liking. If Aragorn and Legolas will guard him, and answer
for him, he shall pass; but he must go blindfold through Lothlurien. 'But now we must debate no longer. Your folk must not remain on the
ground. We have been keeping watch on the rivers, ever since we saw a great
troop of Ores going north toward Moria, along the skirts of the mountains,
many days ago. Wolves are howling on the wood's borders. If you have indeed
come from Moria, the peril cannot be far behind. Tomorrow early you must go
on. 'The four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with us- we do not fear
them! There is another ta Ian in the next tree. There the others must take
refuge. You, Legolas, must answer to us for them. Call us, if anything is
amiss! And have an eye on that dwarf!' Legolas at once went down the ladder to take Haldir's message; and soon
afterwards Merry and Pippin clambered up on to the high flet. They were out
of breath and seemed rather scared. 'There!' said Merry panting. 'We have lugged up your blankets as well
as our own. Strider has hidden all the rest of the baggage in a deep drift
of leaves.’ 'You had no need of your burdens,' said Haldir. 'It is cold in the
tree-tops in winter, though the wind tonight is in the South; but we have
food and drink to give you that will drive away the night-chill, and we have
skins and cloaks to spare.’ The hobbits accepted this second (and far better) supper very gladly. Then they wrapped themselves warmly, not only in the fur-cloaks of the
Elves, but in their own blankets as well, and tried to go to sleep. But
weary as they were only Sam found that easy to do. Hobbits do not like
heights, and do not sleep upstairs, even when they have any stairs. The flet
was not at all to their liking as a bedroom. It had no walls, not even a
rail; only on one side was there a light plaited screen, which could be
moved and fixed in different places according to the wind. Pippin went on talking for a while. 'I hope, if I do go to sleep in
this bed-loft, that I shan't roll off,' he said. 'Once I do get to sleep,’ said Sam, ’i shall go on sleeping, whether I
roll off or no. And the less said, the sooner I'll drop off, if you take my
meaning.'
Frodo lay for some time awake, and looked up at the stars glinting
through the pale roof of quivering leaves. Sam was snoring at his side long
before he himself closed his eyes. He could dimly see the grey forms of two
elves sitting motionless with their arms about their knees, speaking in
whispers. The other had gone down to take up his watch on one of the lower
branches. At last lulled by the wind in the boughs above, and the sweet
murmur of the falls of Nimrodel below, Frodo fell asleep with the song of
Legolas running in his mind. Late in the night he awoke. The other hobbits were asleep. The Elves
were gone. The sickle Moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves. The wind
was still. A little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on
the ground below. There was a ring of metal. The sounds died slowly away,
and seemed to go southward, on into the wood. A head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet. Frodo sat up in
alarm and saw that it was a grey-hooded Elf. He looked towards the hobbits. 'What is it? ' said Frodo. ' Yrch !' said the Elf in a hissing whisper, and cast on to the flet the
rope-ladder rolled up. 'Ores! ' said Frodo. 'What are they doing? ' But the Elf had gone. There were no more sounds. Even the leaves were silent, and the very
falls seemed to be hushed. Frodo sat and shivered in his wraps. He was
thankful that they had not been caught on the ground; but he felt that the
trees offered little protection, except concealment. Ores were as keen as
hounds on a scent, it was said, but they could also climb. He drew out
Sting: it flashed and glittered like a blue flame and then slowly faded
again and grew dull. In spite of the fading of his sword the feeling of
immediate danger did not leave Frodo, rather it grew stronger. He got up and
crawled to the opening and peered down. He was almost certain that he could
hear stealthy movements at the tree’s foot far below. Not Elves; for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their
movements. Then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing: and something seemed
to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree-trunk. He stared down into the
dark, holding his breath. Something was now climbing slowly, and its breath came like a soft
hissing through closed teeth. Then coming up, close to the stem, Frodo saw
two pale eyes. They stopped and gazed upward unwinking. Suddenly they
turned away, and a shadowy figure slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanished. Immediately afterwards Haldir came climbing swiftly up through the
branches. 'There was something in this tree that I have never seen before,'
he said. 'It was not an ore. It fled as soon as I touched the tree -stem. It
seemed to be wary, and to have some skill in trees, or I might have thought
that it was one of you hobbits. I did not shoot, for I dared not arouse any cries: we cannot risk
battle. A strong company of Ores has passed. They crossed the Nimrodel-curse
their foul feet in its clean water! -and went on down the old road beside the
river. They seemed to pick up some scent, and they searched the ground for a
while near the place where you halted. The three of us could not challenge a
hundred, so we went ahead and spoke with feigned voices, leading them on
into the wood. 'Orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our
people. None of the Ores will ever return out of Lurien. And there will be
many Elves hidden on the northern border before another night falls. But you
must take the road south as soon as it is fully light.’ Day came pale from the East. As the light grew it filtered through the
yellow leaves of the mallorn, and it seemed to the hobbits that the early
sun of a cool summer's morning was shining. Pale-blue sky peeped among the
moving branches. Looking through an opening on the south side of the flet
Frodo saw all the valley of the Silverlode lying like a sea of fallow gold
tossing gently in the breeze. The morning was still young and cold when the Company set out again,
guided now by Haldir and his brother R®mil. 'Farewell, sweet Nimrodel! '
cried Legolas. Frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among
the grey tree-stems. 'Farewell,' he said. It seemed to him that he would never
hear again a running water so beautiful, for ever blending its innumerable
notes in an endless changeful music. They went back to the path that still went on along the west side of
the Silverlode, and for some way they followed it southward. There were the
prints of ore-feet in the earth. But soon Haldir turned aside into the trees
and halted on the bank of the river under their shadows. 'There is one of my people yonder across the stream,' he said 'though
you may not see him.' He gave a call like the low whistle of a bird, and out
of a thicket of young trees an Elf stepped, clad in grey, but with his hood
thrown back; his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun. Haldir skilfully
cast over the stream a coil of grey rope, and he caught it and bound the end
about a tree near the bank. 'Celebrant is already a strong stream here, as you see,' said Haldir
'and it runs both swift and deep, and is very cold. We do not set foot in it
so far north, unless we must. But in these days of watchfulness we do not
make bridges. This is how we cross! Follow me!' He made his end of the rope
fast about another tree, and then ran lightly along it, over the river and
back again, as if he were on a road. V I can walk this path,' said Legolas; 'but the others have not this
skill. Must they swim?’ 'No!' said Haldir. 'We have two more ropes. We will fasten them above
the other, one shoulder-high, and another half-high, and holding these the
strangers should be able to cross with care.' When this slender bridge had been made, the Company passed over, some
cautiously and slowly, others more easily. Of the hobbits Pippin proved the
best for he was sure-footed, and he walked over quickly, holding only with
one hand; but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down. Sam
shuffled along, clutching hard, and looking down into the pale eddying water
as if it was a chasm in the mountains. He breathed with relief when he was safely across. 'Live and learn! as
my gaffer used to say. Though he was thinking of gardening, not of roosting
like a bird, nor of trying to walk like a spider. Not even my uncle Andy
ever did a trick like that! ’ When at length all the Company was gathered on the east bank of the
Silverlode, the Elves untied the ropes and coiled two of them. R®mil, who
had remained on the other side, drew back the last one, slung it on his
shoulder, and with a wave of his hand went away, back to Nimrodel to keep
watch. 'Now, friends,' said Haldir, 'you have entered the Naith of Lurien or
the Gore, as you would say, for it is the land that lies like a spear -head
between the arms of Silverlode and Anduin the Great. We allow no strangers
to spy out the secrets of the Naith. Few indeed are permitted even to set
foot there. 'As was agreed, I shall here blindfold the eyes of Gimli the Dwarf. The
other may walk free for a while, until we come nearer to our dwellings, down
in Egladil, in the Angle between the waters.' This was not at all to the liking of Gimli. 'The agreement was made
without my consent,' he said. 'I will not walk blindfold, like a beggar or a
prisoner. And I am no spy. My folk have never had dealings with any of the
servants of the Enemy. Neither have we done harm to the Elves. I am no more
likely to betray you than Legolas, or any other of my companions.’ ’I do not doubt you,’ said Haldir. 'Yet this is our law. I am not the
master of the law, and cannot set it aside. I have done much in letting you
set foot over Celebrant.' Gimli was obstinate. He planted his feet firmly apart, and laid his
hand upon the haft of his axe. 'I will go forward free,' he said, 'or I will
go back and seek my own land, where I am known to be true of word, though I
perish alone in the wilderness.' 'You cannot go back,' said Haldir sternly. 'Now you have come thus far,
you must be brought before the Lord and the Lady. They shall judge you, to
hold you or to give you leave, as they will. You cannot cross the rivers
again, and behind you there are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass. You would be slain before you saw them.' Gimli drew his axe from his belt. Haldir and his companion bent their
bows. 'A plague on Dwarves and their stiff necks! ' said Legolas. 'Come!' said Aragorn. 'If I am still to lead this Company, you must do
as I bid. It is hard upon the Dwarf to be thus singled out. We will all be
blindfold, even Legolas. That will be best, though it will make the journey
slow and dull.' Gimli laughed suddenly. 'A merry troop of fools we shall look! Will
Haldir lead us all on a string, like many blind beggars with one dog? But I
will be content, if only Legolas here shares my blindness.’ 'I am an Elf and a kinsman here,’ said Legolas, becoming angry in his
turn. 'Now let us cry: "a plague on the stiff necks of Elves!"' said Aragorn. 'But the Company shall all fare alike. Come, bind our eyes Haldir! ' 'I shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe, if you do
not lead us well,’ said Gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes. 'You will have no claim,' said Haldir. 'I shall lead you well, and the
paths are smooth and straight.’ 'Alas for the folly of these days! ’ said Legolas. 'Here all are
enemies of the one Enemy, and yet I must walk blind, while the sun is merry
in the woodland under leaves of gold! ' 'Folly it may seem,' said Haldir. ’Indeed in nothing is the power of
the Dark Lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all
those who still oppose him. Yet so little faith and trust do we find now in
the world beyond Lothlurien, unless maybe in Rivendell, that we dare not by
our own trust endanger our land. We live now upon an island amid many
perils, and our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp. 'The rivers long defended us, but they are a sure guard no more for the
Shadow has crept northward all about us. Some speak of departing, yet for
that it already seems too late. The mountains to the west are growing evil;
to the east the lands are waste, and full of Sauron’s creatures; and it is
rumoured that we cannot now safely pass southward through Rohan, and the
mouths of the Great River are watched by the Enemy. Even if we could come
to the shores of the Sea, we should find no longer any shelter there. It is
said that there are still havens of. the High Elves, but they are far north
and west, beyond the land of the Halflings. But where that may be, though
the Lord and Lady may know, I do not.’ 'You ought at least to guess, since you have seen us,’ said Merry. 'There are Elf-havens west of my land, the Shire where Hobbits live.’ 'Happy folk are Hobbits to dwell near the shores of the sea! ’ said
Haldir. ’It is long indeed since any of my folk have looked on it, yet still
we remember it in song. Tell me of these havens as we walk.’ 'I cannot,’ said Merry. 'I have never seen them. I have never been out
of my own land before. And if I had known what the world outside was like. I
don’t think I should have had the heart to leave it.’ 'Not even to see fair Lothlurien? ’ said Haldir. ’The world is indeed
full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much
that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it
grows perhaps the greater. 'Some there are among us who sing that the Shadow will draw back and
peace shall come again. Yet I do not believe that the world about us will
ever again be as it was of old, or the light of the Sun as it was aforetime. For the Elves, I fear, it will prove at best a truce, in which they may pass
to the Sea unhindered and leave the Middle-earth for ever. Alas for
Lothlurien that I love! It would be a poor life in a land where no mallorn
grew. But if there are mallorn-trees beyond the Great Sea, none have
reported it.' As they spoke thus, the Company filed slowly along the paths in the
wood, led by Haldir, while the other Elf walked behind. They felt the ground
beneath their feet smooth and soft, and after a while they walked more
freely, without fear of hurt or fall. Being deprived of sight, Frodo found
his hearing and other senses sharpened. He could smell the trees and the
trodden grass. He could hear many different notes in the rustle of the
leaves overhead, the river murmuring away on his right, and the thin clear
voices of birds in the sky. He felt the sun upon his face and hands when
they passed through an open glade. As soon as he set foot upon the far bank of Silverlode a strange
feeling had come upon him, and it deepened as he walked on into the Naith:
it seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of
the Elder Days, and was -now walking in a world that was no more. In
Rivendell there was memory of ancient things; in Lurien the ancient things
still lived on in the waking world. Evil had been seen and heard there,
sorrow had been known; the Elves feared and distrusted the world outside:
wolves were howling on the wood's borders: but on the land of Lurien no
shadow lay. All that day the Company marched on, until they felt the cool evening
come and heard the early night- wind whispering among many leaves. Then
they rested and slept without fear upon the ground; for their guides would not
permit them to unbind their eyes, and they could not climb. In the morning
they went on again, walking without haste. At noon they halted, and Frodo
was aware that they had passed out under the shining Sun. Suddenly he heard
the sound of many voices all around him. A marching host of Elves had come up silently: they were hastening
toward the northern borders to guard against any attack from Moria; and they
brought news, some of which Haldir reported. The marauding ores had been
waylaid and almost all destroyed; the remnant had fled westward towards the
mountains, and were being pursued. A strange creature also had been seen,
running with bent back and with hands near the ground, like a beast and yet
notofbeast-shape.lt had eluded capture, and they had not shot it, not
knowing whether it was good or ill, and it had vanished down the Silverlode
southward.
'Also,' said Haldir, "they bring me a message from the Lord and Lady of
the Galadhrim. You are all to walk free, even the dwarf Gimli. It seems that
the Lady knows who and what is each member of your Company. New
messages have come from Rivendell perhaps.' He removed the bandage first from Gimli' s eyes. 'Your pardon! ' he
said, bowing low. "Look on us now with friendly eyes! Look and be glad, for
you are the first dwarf to behold the trees of the Naith of Lurien since
Durin's Day! ' When his eyes were in turn uncovered, Frodo looked up and caught his
breath. They were standing in an open space. To the left stood a great
mound, covered with a sward of grass as green as Spring-time in the Elder
Days. Upon it, as a double crown, grew two circles of trees: the outer had
bark of snowy white, and were leafless but beautiful in their shapely
nakedness; the inner were mallorn-trees of great height, still arrayed in
pale gold. High amid the branches of a towering tree that stood in the
centre of all there gleamed a white flet. At the feet of the trees, and all
about the green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers
shaped like stars. Among them, nodding on slender stalks, were other
flowers, white and palest green: they glimmered as a mist amid the rich hue
of the grass. Over all the sky was blue, and the sun of afternoon glowed
upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees. 'Behold! You are come to Cerin Amroth,' said Haldir. "For this is the
heart of the ancient realm as it was long ago, and here is the mound of
Amroth, where in happier days his high house was built. Here ever bloom the
winter flowers in the unfading grass: the yellow elanor, and the pale
niphredil. Here we will stay awhile, and come to the city of the Galadhrim
at dusk.' The others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass, but Frodo
stood awhile still lost in wonder. It seemed to him that he had stepped
through a high window that looked on a vanished world. A light was upon it
for which his language had no name. All that he saw was shapely, but the
shapes seemed at once clear cut, as if they had been first conceived and
drawn at the uncovering of his eyes, and ancient as if they had endured for
ever. He saw no colour but those he knew, gold and white and blue and green,
but they were fresh and poignant, as if he had at that moment first
perceived them and made for them names new and wonderful. In winter here
no heart could mourn for summer or for spring. No blemish or sickness or
deformity could be seen in anything that grew upon the earth. On the land of
Lurien there was no stain. He turned and saw that Sam was now standing beside him, looking round
with a puzzled expression, and rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that
he was awake. 'It's sunlight and bright day, right enough,' he said. 'I
thought that Elves were all for moon and stars: but this is more elvish than
anything I ever heard tell of. I feel as if I was inside a song, if you take
my meaning.' Haldir looked at them, and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both
thought and word. He smiled. 'You feel the power of the Lady of the
Galadhrim,' he said. 'Would it please you to climb with me up Cerin Amroth? f They followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass-clad slopes.
Though he walked and breathed, and about him living leaves and flowers were
stirred by the same cool wind as fanned his face, Frodo felt that he was in
a timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness. When
he had gone and passed again into the outer world, still Frodo the wanderer
from the Shire would walk there, upon the grass among elanor and niphredil
in fair Lothlurien. They entered the circle of white trees. As they did so the South Wind
blew upon Cerin Amroth and sighed among the branches. Frodo stood still,
hearing far off_ great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away,
and sea-birds crying whose race had perished from the earth. Haldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet. As Frodo
prepared to follow him, he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder:
never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and
texture of a tree's skin and of the life within it. He felt a delight in
wood and the touch of it, neither as forester nor as carpenter; it was the
delight of the living tree itself. As he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform, Haldir took his hand
and turned him toward the South. 'Look this way first! ’ he said. Frodo looked and saw, still at some distance, a hill of many mighty
trees, or a city of green towers: which it was he could not tell. Out of it,
it seemed to him that the power and light came that held all the land in
sway. He longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city. Then
he looked eastward and saw all the land of Lurien running down to the pale
gleam of Anduin, the Great River. He lifted his eyes across the river and
all the light went out, and he was back again in the world he knew. Beyond
the river the land appeared flat and empty, formless and vague, until far
away it rose again like a wall, dark and drear. The sun that lay on
Lothlurien had no power to enlighten the shadow of that distant height. 'There lies the fastness of Southern Mirkwood,' said Haldir. 'It is
clad in a forest of dark fir, where the trees strive one against another and
their branches rot and wither. In the midst upon a stony height stands Dol
Guldur, where long the hidden Enemy had his dwelling. We fear that now it is
inhabited again, and with power sevenfold. A black cloud lies often over it
of late. In this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one
to another; and ever they strive now in thought, but whereas the light
perceives the very heart of the darkness, its own secret has not been
discovered. Not yet.' He turned and climbed swiftly down, and they followed
him. At the hill's foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still and silent as a
tree; but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor, and a light was in
his eyes. He was wrapped in some fair memory: and as Frodo looked at him he
knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place. For the
grim years were removed from the face of Aragorn, and he seemed clothed in
white, a young lord tall and fair; and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue
to one whom Frodo could not see. Arwen vanimelda, nambril! he said, and then
he drew a breath, and returning out of his thought he looked at Frodo and
smiled. 'Here is the heart of Elvendom on earth,' he said, 'and here my heart
dwells ever, unless there be a light beyond the dark roads that we still
must tread, you and I. Come with me! ' And taking Frodo's hand in his, he
left the hill of Cerin Amroth and came there never again as living man.
Chapter 7 . The Mirror of Galadriel The sun was sinking behind the mountains, and the shadows were
deepening in the woods, when they went on again. Their paths now went into
thickets where the dusk had already gathered. Night came beneath the trees
as they walked, and the Elves uncovered their silver lamps. Suddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a
pale evening sky pricked by a few early stars. There was a wide treeless
space before them, running in a great circle and bending away on either
hand. Beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow, but the grass upon its
brink was green, as if it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone.
Upon the further side there rose to a great height a green wall encircling a
green hill thronged with mallorn-trees taller than any they had yet seen in
all the land. Their height could not be guessed, but they stood up in the
twilight like living towers. In their, many -tiered branches and amid their
ever-moving leaves countless lights were gleaming, green and gold and
silver. Haldir turned towards the Company. 'Welcome to Caras Galadhon! ' he said. 'Here is the city of the
Galadhrim where dwell the Lord Celeborn and Galadriel the Lady of Lurien.
But we cannot enter here, for the gates do not look northward. We must go
round to the southern side, and the way is not short, for the city is
great.' There was a road paved with white stone running on the outer brink of
the fosse. Along this they went westward, with the city ever climbing up
like a green cloud upon their left; and as the night deepened more lights
sprang forth, until all the hill seemed afire with stars. They came at last
to a white bridge, and crossing found the great gates of the city: they
faced south-west, set between the ends of the encircling wall that here
overlapped, and they were tall and strong, and hung with many lamps. Haldir knocked and spoke, and the gates opened soundlessly; but of
guards Lrodo could see no sign. The travellers passed within, and the gates
shut behind them. They were in a deep lane between the ends of the wall, and
passing quickly through it they entered the City of the Trees. No folk could
they see, nor hear any feet upon the paths; but there were many voices,
about them, and in the air above. Ear away up on the hill they could hear
the sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves. They went along many paths and climbed many stairs, until they came to
the high places and saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering.
It was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees, and it fell
into a basin of silver, from which a white stream spilled. Upon the south
side of the lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees; its great
smooth bole gleamed like grey silk, and up it towered, until its first
branches, far above, opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves.
Beside it a broad white ladder stood, and at its foot three Elves were
seated. They sprang up as the travellers approached, and Frodo saw that they
were tall and clad in grey mail, and from their shoulders hung long white
cloaks. 'Here dwell Celeborn and Galadriel,' said Haldir. v It is their wish
that you should ascend and speak with them.' One of the Elf-wardens then blew a clear note on a small horn, and it
was answered three times from far above. V I will go first,' said Haldir. 'Let Frodo come next and with him Legolas. The others may follow as they
wish. It is a long climb for those that are not accustomed to such stairs,
but you may rest upon the way.' As he climbed slowly up Frodo passed many flets: some on one side, some
on another, and some set about the bole of the tree, so that the ladder
passed through them. At a great height above the ground he came to a wide
talan, like the deck of a great ship. On it was built a house, so large that
almost it would have served for a hall of Men upon the earth. He entered
behind Haldir, and found that he was in a chamber of oval shape, in the
midst of which grew the trunk of the great mallorn, now tapering towards its
crown, and yet making still a pillar of wide girth. The chamber was filled with a soft light; its walls were green and
silver and its roof of gold. Many Elves were seated there. On two chairs
beneath the bole of the tree and canopied by a living bough there sat, side
by side, Celeborn and Galadriel. They stood up to greet their guests, after
the manner of Elves, even those who were accounted mighty kings. Very tall
they were, and the Lady no less tall than the Lord; and they were grave and
beautiful. They were clad wholly in white; and the hair of the Lady was of
deep gold, and the hair of the Lord Celeborn was of silver long and bright;
but no sign of age was upon them, unless it were in the depths of their
eyes; for these were keen as lances in the starlight, and yet profound, the
wells of deep memory. Haldir led Frodo before them, and the Lord welcomed him in his own
tongue. The Lady Galadriel said no word but looked long upon his face. 'Sit now beside my chair, Frodo of the Shire! ' said Celeborn. 'When
all have come we will speak together.' Each of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered.
'Welcome Aragorn son of Arathorn! ’ he said. 'It is eight and thirty years
of the world outside since you came to this land; and those years lie heavy
on you. But the end is near, for good or ill. Here lay aside your burden for
a while ! ' 'Welcome son of Thranduil! Too seldom do my kindred journey hither from
the North.' 'Welcome Gimli son of Gluin! It is long indeed since we saw one of
Durin's folk in Caras Galadhon. But today we have broken our long law. May
it be a sign that though the world is now dark better days are at hand, and
that friendship shall be renewed between our peoples.' Gimli bowed low. When all the guests were seated before his chair the Lord looked at
them again. 'Here there are eight,' he said. 'Nine were to set out: so said
the messages. But maybe there has been some change of counsel that we have
not heard. Elrond is far away, and darkness gathers between us, and all this
year the shadows have grown longer.’ 'Nay, there was no change of counsel,' said the Lady Galadriel speaking
for the first time. Her voice was clear and musical, but deeper than woman's
wont. 'Gandalf the Grey set out with the Company, but he did not pass the
borders of this land. Now tell us where he is; for I much desired to speak
with him again. But I cannot see him from afar, unless he comes within the
fences of Lothlurien: a grey mist is about him, and the ways of his feet and
of his mind are hidden from me.’ 'Alas! ' said Aragorn. 'Gandalf the Grey fell into shadow. He remained
in Moria and did not escape.' At these words all the Elves in the hall cried aloud in grief and
amazement. 'These are evil tidings,' said Celeborn, 'the most evil that have
been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds.' He turned to Haldir.
'Why has nothing of this been told to me before? ' he asked in the
Elven-tongue. 'We have not spoken to Haldir of our deeds or our purpose,' said
Legolas. 'At first we were weary and danger was too close behind and
afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time, as we walked in gladness
on the fair paths of Lurien.' 'Yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended,' said Frodo.
’Gandalf was our guide, and he led us through Moria; and when our escape
seemed beyond hope he saved us, and he fell.’ Tell us now the full tale! ' said Celeborn: Then Aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass of
Caradhras, and in the days that followed; and he spoke of Balin and his
book, and the fight in the Chamber of Mazarbul, and the fire, and the narrow
bridge, and the coming of the Terror. 'An evil of the Ancient World it
seemed, such as I have never seen before,' said Aragorn. 'It was both a
shadow and a flame, strong and terrible.' 'It was a Balrog of Morgoth,' said Legolas; 'of all elf-banes the most
deadly, save the One who sits in the Dark Tower.’ 'Indeed I saw upon the bridge that which haunts our darkest dreams 1
saw Durin's Bane,' said Gimli in a low voice, and dread was in his eyes. 'Alas! ' said Celeborn. 'We long have feared that under Caradhras a
terror slept. But had I known that the Dwarves had stirred up this evil in
Moria again, 1 would have forbidden you to pass the northern borders, you
and all that went with you. And if it were possible, one would say that at
the last Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the net
of Moria.' 'He would be rash indeed that said that thing,' said Galadriel gravely.
'Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life. Those that followed him
knew not his mind and cannot report his full purpose. But however it may be
with the guide, the followers are blameless. Do not repent of your welcome
to the Dwarf. If our folk had been exiled long and far from Lothlurien, who
of the Galadhrim, even Celeborn the Wise, would pass nigh and would not
wish to look upon their ancient home, though it had become an abode of dragons? 'Dark is the water of Kheled-zvram, and cold are the springs of
Kibil-nvla, and fair were the many -pillared halls of Khazad-dym in Elder
Days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone.' She looked upon
Gimli, who sat glowering and sad, and she smiled. And the Dwarf, hearing the
names given in his own ancient tongue, looked up and met her eyes; and it
seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw
there love and understanding. Wonder came into his face, and then he smiled
in answer. He rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf-fashion, saying: 'Yet more fair is
the living land of Lurien, and the Lady Galadriel is above all the jewels
that lie beneath the earth! ' There was a silence. At length Celeborn spoke again. 'I did not know
that your plight was so evil,’ he said. 'Let Gimli forget my harsh words: I
spoke in the trouble of my heart. I will do what I can to aid you, each
according to his wish and need, but especially that one of the little folk
who bears the burden.' 'Your quest is known to us,' said Galadriel, looking at Frodo. 'But we
will not here speak of it more openly. Yet not in vain will it prove, maybe,
that you came to this land seeking aid, as Gandalf himself plainly purposed.
For the Lord of the Galadhrim is accounted the wisest of the Elves of
Middle-earth, and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kings. He has dwelt
in the West since the days of dawn, and I have dwelt with him years
uncounted; for ere the fall of Nargothrond or Gondolin I passed over the
mountains, and together through ages of the world we have fought the long
defeat. ’I it was who first summoned the White Council. And if my designs had
not gone amiss, it would have been governed by Gandalf the Grey, and then
mayhap things would have gone otherwise. But even now there is hope left. I
will not give you counsel, saying do this, or do that. For not in doing or
contriving, nor in choosing between this course and another, can I avail;
but only in knowing what was and is, and in part also what shall be. But
this I will say to you: your Quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray
but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all. Yet hope remains while
all the Company is true.’ And with that word she held them with her eyes, and in silence looked
searchingly at each of them in turn. None save Legolas and Aragorn could
long endure her glance. Sam quickly blushed and hung his head. At length the Lady Galadriel released them from her eyes, and she
smiled. 'Do not let your hearts be troubled,' she said. 'Tonight you shall
sleep in peace.' Then they sighed and felt suddenly weary, as those who have
been questioned long and deeply, though no words had been spoken openly. 'Go now! ' said Celeborn. 'You are worn with sorrow and much toil. Even
if your Quest did not concern us closely, you should have refuge in this
City, until you were healed and refreshed. Now you shall rest, and we will
not speak of your further road for a while.' That night the Company slept upon the ground, much to the satisfaction
of the hobbits. The Elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees near
the fountain, and in it they laid soft couches; then speaking words of peace
with fair elvish voices they left them. For a little while the travellers
talked of their night before in the tree-tops, and of their day's journey,
and of the Lord and Lady; for they had not yet the heart to look further
back. 'What did you blush for, Sam? ’ said Pippin. 'You soon broke down.
Anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience. I hope it was nothing
worse than a wicked plot to steal one of my blankets.’ 'I never thought no such thing,’ answered Sam, in no mood for jest. ’If
you want to know, I felt as if I hadn’t got nothing on, and I didn't like
it. She seemed to be looking inside me and asking me what I would do if she
gave me the chance of flying back home to the Shire to a nice little hole
with-with a bit of garden of my own.' 'That's funny,' said Merry. 'Almost exactly what I felt myself; only,
only well, I don't think I'll say any more,' he ended lamely. All of them, it seemed, had fared alike: each had felt that he was
offered a choice between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead, and something
that he greatly desired: clear before his mind it lay, and to get it he had
only to turn aside from the road and leave the Quest and the war against
Sauron to others. 'And it seemed to me, too,' said Gimli, 'that my choice would remain
secret and known only to myself.’ 'To me it seemed exceedingly strange,' said Boromir. 'Maybe it was only
a test, and she thought to read our thoughts for her own good purpose; but
almost I should have said that she was tempting us, and offering what she
pretended to have the power to give. It need not be said that I refused to
listen. The Men of Minas Tirith are true to their word.’ But what he thought
that the Lady had offered him Boromir did not tell. And as for Frodo, he would not speak, though Boromir pressed him with
questions. 'She held you long in her gaze, Ring -bearer,’ he said. 'Yes,' said Frodo; 'but whatever came into my mind then I will keep
there.' 'Well, have a care! 'said Boromir. 'I do not feel too sure of this
Elvish Lady and her purposes.’
'Speak no evil of the Lady Galadriel! ' said Aragorn sternly. 'You know
not what you say. There is in her and in this land no evil, unless a man
bring it hither himself . Then let him beware ! But tonight I shall sleep
without fear for the first time since I left Rivendell. And may I sleep
deep, and forget for a while my grief! I am weary in body and in heart.' He
cast himself down upon his couch and fell at once into a long sleep. The others soon did the same, and no sound or dream disturbed their
slumber. When they woke they found that the light of day was broad upon the
lawn before the pavilion, and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the
sun. They remained some days in Lothlurien, so far as they could tell or
remember. All the while that they dwelt there the sun shone clear, save for
a gentle rain that fell at times, and passed away leaving all things fresh
and clean. The air was cool and soft, as if it were early spring, yet they
felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter. It seemed to them
that they did little but eat and drink and rest, and walk among the trees;
and it was enough. They had not seen the Lord and Lady again, and they had little speech
with the Elven-folk; for few of these knew or would use the Westron tongue.
Haldir had bidden them farewell and gone back again to the fences of the
North, where great watch was now kept since the tidings of Moria that the
Company had brought. Legolas was away much among the Galadhrim, and
after the first night he did not sleep with the other companions, though he
returned to eat and talk with them. Often he took Gimli with him when he
went abroad in the land, and the others wondered at this change. Now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of Gandalf, and
all that each had known and seen of him came clear before their minds. As
they were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew
more keen. Often they heard nearby Elvish voices singing, and knew that they
were making songs of lamentation for his fall, for they caught his name
among the sweet sad words that they could not understand. Mithrandir, Mithrandir sang the Elves, O Pilgrim Grey! For so they
loved to call him. But if Legolas was with the Company, he would not
interpret the songs for them, saying that he had not the skill, and that for
him the grief was still too near, a matter for tears and not yet for song. It was Frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words.
He was seldom moved to make song or rhyme; even in Ri vendell he had
listened and had not sung himself, though his memory was stored with many things that
others had made before him. But now as he sat beside the fountain in Lurien
and heard about him the voices of the Elves, his thought took shape in a
song that seemed fair to him; yet when he tried to repeat it to Sam only
snatches remained, faded as a handful of withered leaves. When evening in the Shire was grey
his footsteps on the Hill were heard;
before the dawn he went away
on journey long without a word. From Wilderland to Western shore,
from northern waste to southern hill,
through dragon-lair and hidden door
and darkling woods he walked at will. With Dwarf and Hobbit, Elves and Men,
with mortal and immortal folk,
with bird on bough and beast in den,
in their own secret tongues he spoke. A deadly sword, a healing hand,
a back that bent beneath its load;
a trumpet-voice, a burning brand,
a weary pilgrim on the road. A lord of wisdom throned he sat,
swift in anger, quick to laugh;
an old man in a battered hat
who leaned upon a thorny staff. He stood upon the bridge alone
and Fire and Shadow both defied;
his staff was broken on the stone,
in Khazad-dym his wisdom died. 'Why, you'll be beating Mr. Bilbo next! ' said Sam.
'No, I am afraid not,' said Frodo. 'But that is the best I can do yet.' 'Well, Mr. Frodo, if you do have another go, I hope you'll say a word
about his fireworks,' said Sam. 'Something like this: The finest rockets ever seen:
they burst in stars of blue and green,
or after thunder golden showers
came falling like a rain of flowers. Though that doesn't do them justice by a long road.' 'No, I'll leave that to you, Sam. Or perhaps to Bilbo. But-well. I
can't talk of it any more. I can't bear to think of bringing the news to
him.' One evening Frodo and Sam were walking together in the cool twilight.
Both of them felt restless again. On Frodo suddenly the shadow of parting
had fallen: he knew somehow that the time was very near when he must leave
Lothlurien. 'What do you think of Elves now, Sam? ’ he said. 'I asked you the same
question once before-it seems a very long while ago; but you have seen more
of them since then.' 'I have indeed! ' said Sam. 'And I reckon there's Elves and Elves. They're all elvish enough, but they're not all the same. Now these folk
aren't wanderers or homeless, and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us: they
seem to belong here, more even than Flobbits do in the Shire. Whether they've
made the land, or the land's made them, it's hard to say, if you take my
meaning. It's wonderfully quiet here. Nothing seems to be going on, and
nobody seems to want it to. If there's any magic about, it's right down
deep, where I can't lay my hands on it, in a manner of speaking.' 'You can see and feel it everywhere,' said Frodo. 'Well,' said Sam, 'you can't see nobody working it. No fireworks like
poor Gandalf used to show. I wonder we don't see nothing of the Lord and
Lady in all these days. I fancy now that she could do some wonderful things,
if she had a mind. I'd dearly love to see some Elf-magic, Mr. Frodo! ' 'I wouldn't,' said Frodo. 'I am content. And I don't miss Gandalf's
fireworks, but his bushy eyebrows, and his quick temper, and his voice.' 'You're right,' said Sam. 'And don't think I'm finding fault. I've
often wanted to see a bit of magic like what it tells of in old tales, but
I've never heard of a better land than this. It's like being at home and on
a holiday at the same time, if you understand me. I don't want to leave. All
the same, I'm beginning to feel that if we’ve got to go on, then we'd best
get it over. 'It's the job that's never started as takes longest to finish, as my
old gaffer used to say. And I don't reckon that these folk can do much more
to help us, magic or no. It's when we leave this land that we shall miss
Gandalf worse, I'm thinking.' 'I am afraid that's only too true, Sam,' said Frodo. 'Yet I hope very
much that before we leave we shall see the Lady of the Elves again.' Even as he spoke, they saw, as if she came in answer to their words,
the Lady Galadriel approaching. Tall and white and fair she walked beneath
the trees. She spoke no word, but beckoned to them. Turning aside, she led them toward the southern slopes of the hill of
Caras Galadhon, and passing through a high green hedge they came into an
enclosed garden. No trees grew there, and it lay open to the sky. The
evening star had risen and was shining with white fire above the western
woods. Down a long flight of steps the Lady went into a deep green hollow,
through which ran murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountain
on the hill. At the bottom, upon a low pedestal carved like a branching
tree, stood a basin of silver, wide and shallow, and beside it stood a
silver ewer. With water from the stream Galadriel filled the basin to the brim, and
breathed on it, and when the water was still again she spoke. 'Here is the
Mirror of Galadriel,’ she said. ’I have brought you here so that you may
look in it, if you will.' The air was very still, and the dell was dark, and the Elf-lady beside
him was tall and pale. 'What shall we look for, and what shall we see? '
asked Frodo, filled with awe. 'Many things I can command the Mirror to reveal,' she answered, 'and to
some I can show what they desire to see. But the Mirror will also show
things unbidden, and those are often stranger and more profitable than
things which we wish to behold. What you will see, if you leave the Mirror
free to work, I cannot tell. For it shows things that were, and things that
are, things that yet may be. But which it is that he sees, even the wisest
cannot always tell. Do you wish to look? ' Frodo did not answer. 'And you? ’ she said, turning to Sam. 'For this is what your folk would
call magic. I believe; though I do not understand clearly what they mean;
and they seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy. But
this, if you will, is the magic of Galadriel. Did you not say that you
wished to see Elf-magic? ' 'I did,' said Sam, trembling a little between fear and curiosity. Til
have a peep, Lady, if you're willing.’ 'And I'd not mind a glimpse of what's going on at home,' he said in an
aside to Frodo. 'It seems a terrible long time that I've been away. But
there, like as not I'll only see the stars, or something that I won't
understand.' 'Like as not,' said the Lady with a gentle laugh. 'But come, you shall
look and see what you may. Do not touch the water! ’ Sam climbed up on the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin. The water looked hard and dark. Stars were reflected in it. 'There's only stars, as I thought,' he said. Then he gave a low gasp,
for the stars went out. As if a dark veil had been withdrawn, the Mirror
grew grey, and then clear. There was sun shining, and the branches of trees
were waving and tossing in the wind. But before Sam could make up his mind
what it was that he saw, the light faded; and now he thought he saw Frodo
with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Then he seemed
to see himself going along a dim passage, and climbing an endless winding
stair. It came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something,
but what it was he did not know. Like a dream the vision shifted and went
back, and he saw the trees again. But this time they were not so close, and
he could see what was going on: they were not waving in the wind, they were
falling, crashing to the ground. 'Hi!' cried Sam in an outraged voice. 'There's that Ted Sandyman
a-cutting down trees as he shouldn't. They didn't ought to be felled: it's
that avenue beyond the Mill that shades the road to Bywater. I wish I could
get at Ted, and I'd fell himV But now Sam noticed that the Old Mill had vanished, and a large
red-brick building was being put up where it had stood. Lots of folk were
busily at work. There was a tall red chimney nearby. Black smoke seemed to
cloud the surface of the Mirror. 'There's some devilry at work in the Shire,' he said. 'Elrond knew what
he was about when he wanted to send Mr. Merry back.' Then suddenly Sam
gave a cry and sprang away. 'I can't stay here,' he said wildly. 'I must go home.
They’ve dug up Bagshot Row, and there's the poor old gaffer going down the
Hill with his bits of things on a barrow. I must go home! ’ ’You cannot go home alone,’ said the Lady. ’You did not wish to go home
without your master before you looked in the Mirror, and yet you knew that
evil things might well be happening in the Shire. Remember that the Mirror
shows many things, and not all have yet come to pass. Some never come to be,
unless those that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent
them. The Mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds.’ Sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands. 'I wish I had
never come here, and I don’t want to see no more magic,’ he said and fell
silent. After a moment he spoke again thickly, as if struggling with tears. 'No, I’ll go home by the long road with Mr. Frodo, or not at all,’ he said. 'But I hope I do get back some day. If what I’ve seen turns out true,
somebody’s going to catch it hot! ’ 'Do you now wish to look, Frodo? ’ said the Lady Galadriel. 'You did
not wish to see Elf-magic and were content.’ 'Do you advise me to look? ’ asked Frodo. ’No,’ she said. 'I do not counsel you one way or the other. I am not a
counsellor. You may learn something, and whether what you see be fair or
evil, that may be profitable, and yet it may not. Seeing is both good and
perilous. Yet I think, Frodo, that you have courage and wisdom enough for
the venture, or I would not have brought you here. Do as you will! ’ 'I will look,’ said Frodo, and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over
the dark water. At once the Mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land.
Mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky. A long grey road
wound back out of sight. Far away a figure came slowly down the road, faint
and small at first, but growing larger and clearer as it approached.
Suddenly Frodo realized that it reminded him of Gandalf. He almost called
aloud the wizard’s name, and then he saw that the figure was clothed not in
grey but in white, in a white that shone faintly in the dusk; and in its
hand there was a white staff. The head was so bowed that he could see no
face, and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and
went out of the Mirror's view. Doubt came into Frodo's mind: was this a
vision of Gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago, or was it
Saruman? The vision now changed. Brief and small but very vivid he caught a
glimpse of Bilbo walking restlessly about his room. The table was littered
with disordered papers; rain was beating on the windows. Then there was a pause, and after it many swift scenes followed that
Frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become
involved. The mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before
but knew at once: the Sea. Darkness fell. The sea rose and raged in a great
storm. Then he saw against the Sun, sinking blood-red into a wrack of
clouds, the black outline of a tall ship with torn sails riding up out of
the West. Then a wide river flowing through a populous city. Then a white
fortress with seven towers. And then again a ship with black sails, but now
it was morning again, and the water rippled with light, and a banner bearing
the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun. A smoke as of fire and battle
arose, and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey
mist; and into the mist a small ship passed away, twinkling with lights. It
vanished, and Frodo sighed and prepared to draw away. But suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole had
opened in the world of sight, and Frodo looked into emptiness. In the black
abyss there appeared a single Eye that slowly grew, until it filled nearly
all the Mirror. So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted, unable to cry
out or to withdraw his gaze. The Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself
glazed, yellow as a cat's, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its
pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing. Then the Eye began to rove, searching this way and that; and Frodo knew
with certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he
himself was one. But he also knew that it could not see him-not yet, not
unless he willed it. The Ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew
heavy, heavier than a great stone, and his head was dragged downwards. The
Mirror seemed to be growing hot and curls of steam were rising from the
water. He was slipping forward. 'Do not touch the water!' said the Lady Galadriel softly. The vision
faded, and Frodo found that he was looking at the cool stars twinkling in
the silver basin. He stepped back shaking all over and looked at the Lady. V I know what it was that you last saw,' she said; 'for that is also in
my mind. Do not be afraid! But do not think that only by singing amid the
trees, nor even by the slender arrows of elven-bows, is this land of
Lothlurien maintained and defended against its Enemy. I say to you, Frodo,
that even as I speak to you, I perceive the Dark Lord and know his mind, or
all of his mind that concerns the Elves. And he gropes ever to see me and my
thought. But still the door is closed! ' She lifted up her white arms, and spread out her hands towards the East
in a gesture of rejection and denial. Edrendil, the Evening Star, most
beloved of the Elves, shone clear above. So bright was it that the figure of
the Elven-lady cast a dim shadow on the ground. Its rays glanced upon a ring
about her finger; it glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver
light, and a white stone in it twinkled as if the Even-star had come down to
rest upon her hand. Frodo gazed at the ring with awe; for suddenly it seemed
to him that he understood. 'Yes,' she said, divining his thought, 'it is not permitted to speak of
it, and Elrond could not do so. But it cannot be hidden from the
Ring -bearer, and one who has seen the Eye. Verily it is in the land of
Lurien upon the finger of Galadriel that one of the Three remains. This is
Nenya, the Ring of Adamant, and I am its keeper. 'He suspects, but he does not know — not yet. Do you not see now
wherefore your coming is to us as the footstep of Doom? For if you fail,
then we are laid bare to the Enemy. Yet if you succeed, then our power is
diminished, and Lothlurien will fade, and the tides of Time will sweep it
away. We must depart into the West, or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and
cave, slowly to forget and to be forgotten.' Frodo bent his head. 'And what do you wish? ' he said at last. 'That what should be shall be,’ she answered. 'The love of the Elves
for their land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the Sea, and
their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged. Yet they will
cast all away rather than submit to Sauron: for they know him now. For the
fate of Lothlurien you are not answerable but only for the doing of your own
task. Yet I could wish, were it of any avail, that the One Ring had never
been wrought, or had remained for ever lost.’ 'You are wise and fearless and fair, Lady Galadriel,' said Frodo. 'I
will give you the One Ring, if you ask for it. It is too great a matter for
me.’ Galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh. 'Wise the Lady Galadriel
may be,' she said, 'yet here she has met her match in courtesy. Gently are
you revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting. You begin to
see with a keen eye. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask
what you offer. For many long years I had pondered what I might do, should
the Great Ring come into my hands, and behold! it was brought within my
grasp. The evil that was devised long ago works on in many ways, whether
Sauron himself stands or falls. Would not that have been a noble deed to set
to the credit of his Ring, if I had taken it by force or fear from my guest? 'And now at last it comes. You will give me the Ring freely! In place
of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I shall not be dark, but
beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the
Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Dreadful as the Storm and the
Lightning ! Stronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair! ' She lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a
great light that illuminated her alone and left all else dark. She stood
before Frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement, and beautiful beyond
enduring, terrible and worshipful. Then she let her hand fall, and the light
faded, and suddenly she laughed again, and lo! she was shrunken: a slender
elf-woman, clad in simple white, whose gentle voice was soft and sad. 'I pass the test,' she said. 'I will diminish, and go into the West and
remain Galadriel.' They stood for a long while in silence. At length the Lady spoke again. 'Let us return! ' she said. 'In the morning you must depart for now we have
chosen, and the tides of fate are flowing.' 'I would ask one thing before we go,' said Frodo, 'a thing which I
often meant to ask Gandalf in Rivendell. I am permitted to wear the One
Ring: why cannot I see all the others and know the thoughts of those that
wear them? ’ 'You have not tried,’ she said. 'Only thrice have you set the Ring upon
your finger since you knew what you possessed. Do not try! It would destroy
you. Did not Gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the
measure of each possessor? Before you could use that power you would need
to become far stronger, and to train your will to the domination of others. Yet
even so, as Ring-bearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that
which is hidden, your sight is grown keener. You have perceived my thought
more clearly than many that are accounted wise. You saw the Eye of him that
holds the Seven and the Nine. And did you not see and recognize the ring
upon my finger? Did you see my ring? ’ she asked turning again to Sam. 'No, Lady,' he answered. 'To tell you the truth, I wondered what you
were talking about. I saw a star through your finger. But if you'll pardon
my speaking out, I think my master was right. I wish you'd take his Ring.
You'd put things to rights. You'd stop them digging up the gaffer and
turning him adrift. You'd make some folk pay for their dirty work.' 'I would,' she said. 'That is how it would begin. But it would not stop
with that, alas! We will not speak more of it. Let us go!'
Chapter 8 . Farewell to Lurien That night the Company was again summoned to the chamber of Celeborn,
and there the Lord and Lady greeted them with fair words. At length Celeborn
spoke of their departure. 'Now is the time,' he said, 'when those who wish to continue the Quest
must harden their hearts to leave this land. Those who no longer wish to go
forward may remain here, for a while. But whether they stay or go, none can
be sure of peace. For we are come now to the edge of doom. Here those who
wish may await the oncoming of the hour till either the ways of the world
lie open again, or we summon them to the last need of Lurien. Then they may
return to their own lands, or else go to the long home of those that fall in
battle.’ There was a silence. 'They all resolved to go forward,’ said Galadriel
looking in their eyes. 'As for me,’ said Boromir, 'my way home lies onward and not back.’ 'That is true,’ said Celeborn, 'but is all this Company going with you
to Minas Tirith? ’ 'We have not decided our course,’ said Aragorn. ’Beyond Lothlurien I do
not know what Gandalf intended to do. Indeed I do not think that even he had
any clear purpose.’ 'Maybe not,’ said Celeborn, 'yet when you leave this land, you can no
longer forget the Great River. As some of you know well, it cannot be
crossed by travellers with baggage between Lurien and Gondor, save by boat.
And are not the bridges of Osgiliath broken down and all the landings held
now by the Enemy? 'On which side will you journey? The way to Minas Tirith lies upon this
side, upon the west; but the straight road of the Quest lies east of the
River, upon the darker shore. Which shore will you now take? ’ 'If my advice is heeded, it will be the western shore, and the way to
Minas Tirith,’ answered Boromir. 'But I am not the leader of the Company.’
The others said nothing, and Aragorn looked doubtful and troubled. 'I see that you do not yet know what to do,’ said Celeborn. 'It is not
my part to choose for you; but I will help you as I may. There are some
among you who can handle boats: Legolas, whose folk know the swift Forest
River; and Boromir of Gondor; and Aragorn the traveller.' 'And one Hobbit! ' cried Merry. 'Not all of us look on boats as wild
horses. My people live by the banks of the Brandywine.' 'That is well,’ said Celeborn. 'Then I will furnish your Company with
boats. They must be small and light, for if you go far by water, there are
places where you will be forced to carry them. You will come to the rapids
of Sarn Gebir, and maybe at last to the great falls of Rauros where the
River thunders down from Nen Hithoel; and there are other perils. Boats may
make your journey less toilsome for awhile. Yet they will not give you
counsel: in the end you must leave them and the River, and turn west-or
east.’ Aragorn thanked Celeborn many times. The gift of boats comforted him
much, not least because there would now be no need to decide his course for
some days. The others, too, looked more hopeful. Whatever perils lay ahead,
it seemed better to float down the broad tide of Anduin to meet them than to
plod forward with bent backs. Only Sam was doubtful: he at any rate still
thought boats as bad as wild horses, or worse, and not all the dangers that
he had survived made him think better of them. 'All shall be prepared for you and await you at the haven before noon
tomorrow,' said Celeborn. 'I will send my people to you in the morning to
help you make ready for the journey. Now we will wish you all a fair night
and untroubled sleep.' 'Good night, my friends! ' said Galadriel. 'Sleep in peace! Do not
trouble your hearts overmuch with thought of the road tonight. Maybe the
paths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet, though
you do not see them. Good night! ' The Company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion.
Legolas went with them, for this was to be their last night in Lothlurien,
and in spite of the words of Galadriel they wished to take counsel together. For a long time they debated what they should do, and how it would be
best to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the Ring: but they came
to no decision. It was plain that most of them desired to go first to Minas
Tirith, and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the Enemy. They would have been willing to follow a leader over the River and into the
shadow of Mordor; but Frodo spoke no word, and Aragorn was still divided in
his mind.
His own plan, while Gandalf remained with them, had been to go with
Boromir, and with his sword help to deliver Gondor. For he believed that the
message of the dreams was a summons, and that the hour had come at last
when the heir of Elendil should come forth and strive with Sauron for the
mastery. But in Moria the burden of Gandalf had been laid on him; and he
knew that he could not now forsake the Ring, if Frodo refused in the end to
go with Boromir. And yet what help could he or any of the Company give to
Frodo, save to walk blindly with him into the darkness? 'I shall go to Minas Tirith, alone if need be, for it is my duty,' said
Boromir; and after that he was silent for a while, sitting with his eyes
fixed on Frodo, as if he was trying to read the Halfling’s thoughts. At
length he spoke again, softly, as if he was debating with himself. 'If you
wish only to destroy the Ring,’ he said, "then there is little use in war
and weapons; and the Men of Minas Tirith cannot help. But if you wish to
destroy the armed might of the Dark Lord, then it is folly to go without
force into his domain; and folly to throw away.' He paused suddenly, as if
he had become aware that he was speaking his thoughts aloud. 'It would be
folly to throw lives away, I mean,' he ended. 'It is a choice between
defending a strong place and walking openly into the arms of death. At
least, that is how I see it.' Frodo caught something new and strange in Boromir's glance, and he
looked hard at him. Plainly Boromir's thought was different from his final
words. It would be folly to throw away: what? The Ring of Power? He had said
something like this at the Council, but then he had accepted the correction
of Elrond. Frodo looked at Aragorn, but he seemed deep in his own thought
and made no sign that he had heeded Boromir's words. And so their debate
ended. Merry and Pippin were already asleep, and Sam was nodding. The
night was growing old. In the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slender goods, Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts
of food and clothing for the journey. The food was mostly in the form of
very thin cakes, made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside,
and inside was the colour of cream. Gimli took up one of the cakes and
looked at it with a doubtful eye. 'Cram,' he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp corner and
nibbled at it. His expression quickly changed, and he ate all the rest of
the cake with relish. 'No more, no more!' cried the Elves laughing. 'You have eaten enough
already for a long day’s march.’ 'I thought it was only a kind of cram , such as the Dale-men make for
journeys in the wild,’ said the Dwarf. 'So it is,’ they answered. 'But we call it lembas or waybread, and it
is more strengthening than any food made by Men, and it is more pleasant
than cram, by all accounts.’ 'Indeed it is,’ said Gimli. ’Why it is better than the honey-cakes of
the Beornings, and that is great praise, for the Beornings are the best
bakers that I know of; but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes
to travellers in these days. You are kindly hosts! ’ ’All the same, we bid you spare the food,’ they said. ’Eat little at a
time, and only at need. For these things are given to serve you when all
else fails. The cakes will keep sweet for many many days, if they are
unbroken and left in their leaf- wrappings, as we have brought them. One will
keep a traveller on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of
the tall Men of Minas Tirith.’ The Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Company the clothes
they had brought. For each they had provided a hood and cloak, made
according to his size, of the light but warm silken stuff that the Galadhrim
wove. It was hard to say of what colour they were: grey with the hue of
twilight under the trees they seemed to be; and yet if they were moved, or
set in another light, they were green as shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow
fields by night, dusk-silver as water under the stars. Each cloak was
fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver. 'Are these magic cloaks? ’ asked Pippin, looking at them with wonder. 'I do not know what you mean by that,’ answered the leader of the
Elves. 'They are fair garments, and the web is good, for it was made in this
land. They are elvish robes certainly, if that is what you mean. Leaf and
branch, water and stone: they have the hue and beauty of all these things
under the twilight of Lurien that we love; for we put the thought of all
that we love into all that we make. Yet they are garments, not armour, and
they will not turn shaft or blade. But they should serve you well: they are
light to wear, and warm enough or cool enough at need. And you will find
them a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes, whether you
walk among the stones or the trees. You are indeed high in the favour of the
Lady! For she herself and her maidens wove this stuff; and never before have
we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.' After their morning meal the Company said farewell to the lawn by the
fountain. Their hearts were heavy; for it was a fair place, and it had
become like home to them, though they could not count the days and nights
that they had passed there. As they stood for a moment looking at the white
water in the sunlight, Haldir came walking towards them over the green grass
of the glade. Frodo greeted him with delight. 'I have returned from the Northern Fences,' said the Elf, 'and I am
sent now to be your guide again. The Dimrill Dale is full of vapour and
clouds of smoke, and the mountains are troubled. There are noises in the
deeps of the earth. If any of you had thought of returning northwards to
your homes, you would not have been able to pass that way. But come! Your
path now goes south.' As they walked through Caras Galadhon the green ways were empty; but in
the trees above them many voices were murmuring and singing. They
themselves went silently. At last Haldir led them down the southward slopes of the
hill, and they came again to the great gate hung with lamps, and to the
white bridge; and so they passed out and left the city of the Elves. Then
they turned away from the paved road and took a path that went off into a
deep thicket of mallorn-trees, and passed on, winding through rolling
woodlands of silver shadow, leading them ever down, southwards and
eastwards, towards the shores of the River. They had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on a
high green wall. Passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the
trees. Before them lay a long lawn of shining grass, studded with golden
elanor that glinted in the sun. The lawn ran out into a narrow tongue
between bright margins: on the right and west the Silverlode flowed
glittering; on the left and east the Great River rolled its broad waters,
deep and dark. On the further shores the woodlands still marched on
southwards as far as the eye could see, but all the banks were bleak and
bare. No mallorn lifted its gold-hung boughs beyond the Land of Lurien. On the bank of the Silverlode, at some distance up from the meeting of
the streams, there was a hythe of white stones and white wood. By it were
moored many boats and barges. Some were brightly painted, and shone with
silver and gold and green, but most were either white or grey. Three small
grey boats had been made ready for the travellers, and in these the Elves
stowed their goods. And they added also coils of rope, three to each boat.
Slender they looked, but strong, silken to the touch, grey of hue like the
elven-cloaks. 'What are these? ' asked Sam, handling one that lay upon the
greensward. 'Ropes indeed! ' answered an Elf from the boats. 'Never travel far
without a rope! And one that is long and strong and light. Such are these.
They may be a help in many needs.' 'You don't need to tell me that! ' said Sam. I came without any and
I've been worried ever since. But I was wondering what these were made of,
knowing a bit about rope -making: it's in the family as you might say.' 'They are made of hithlain,' said the Elf, 'but there is no time now to
instruct you in the art of their making. Had we known that this craft
delighted you, we could have taught you much. But now alas! unless you
should at some time return hither, you must be content with our gift. May it
serve you well ! ' 'Come! ' said Haldir. 'All is now ready for you. Enter the boats! But
take care at first! ’ 'Heed the words! ' said the other Elves. 'These boats are light-built,
and they are crafty and unlike the boats of other folk. They will not sink,
lade them as you will; but they are wayward if mishandled. It would be wise
if you accustomed yourselves to stepping in and out, here where there is a
landing-place, before you set off downstream.' The Company was arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam were in
one boat; Boromir, Merry, and Pippin in another; and in the third were
Legolas and Gimli, who had now become fast friends. In this last boat most
of the goods and packs were stowed. The boats were moved and steered with
short-handled paddles that had broad leaf-shaped blades. When all was ready
Aragorn led them on a trial up the Silverlode. The current was swift and
they went forward slowly. Sam sat in the bows, clutching the sides, and
looking back wistfully to the shore. The sunlight glittering on the water
dazzled his eyes. As they passed beyond the green field of the Tongue, the
trees drew down to the river's brink. Here and there golden leaves tossed
and floated on the rippling stream. The air was very bright and still, and
there was a silence, except for the high distant song of larks.
They turned a sharp bend in the river, and there, sailing proudly down
the stream toward them, they saw a swan of great size. The water rippled on
either side of the white breast beneath its curving neck. Its beak shone
like burnished gold, and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones; its
huge white wings were half lifted. A music came down the river as it drew
nearer; and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship, wrought and carved
with elven-skill in the likeness of a bird. Two elves clad in white steered
it with black paddles. In the midst of the vessel sat Celeborn, and behind
him stood Galadriel, tall and white; a circlet of golden flowers was in her
hair, and in her hand she held a harp, and she sang. Sad and sweet was the
sound of her voice in the cool clear air: I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew: Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew. Beyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea, And by the strand of Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree. Beneath the stars of Ever-eve in Eldamar it shone, In Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion. There long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years, While here beyond the Sundering Seas now fall the Elven-tears. O Lurien! The Winter comes, the bare and leafless Day; The leaves are falling in the stream, the River flows away. O Lurien! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore
And in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor. But if of ships I now should sing, what ship would come to me, What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea? Aragorn stayed his boat as the Swan-ship drew alongside. The Lady ended
her song and greeted them. 'We have come to bid you our last farewell,' she
said, 'and to speed you with blessings from our land.’ 'Though you have been our guests,’ said Celeborn, 'you have not yet
eaten with us, and we bid you, therefore, to a parting feast, here between
the flowing waters that will bear you far from Lurien.' The Swan passed on slowly to the hythe, and they turned their boats and
followed it. There in the last end of Egladil upon the green grass the
parting feast was held; but Frodo ate and drank little, heeding only the
beauty of the Lady and her voice. She seemed no longer perilous or terrible,
nor filled with hidden power. Already she seemed to him, as by men of later
days Elves still at times are seen: present and yet remote, a living vision
of that which has already been left far behind by the flowing streams of
Time. After they had eaten and drunk, sitting upon the grass, Celeborn spoke
to them again of their journey, and lifting his hand he pointed south to the
woods beyond the Tongue. 'As you go down the water,' he said, 'you will find that the trees will
fail, and you will come to a barren country. There the River flows in stony
vale amid high moors, until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall
island of the Tindrock, that we call Tol Brandir. There it casts its arms
about the steep shores of the isle, and falls then with a great noise and
smoke over the cataracts of Rauros down into the Nindalf, the Wetwang as it
is called in your tongue. That is a wide region of sluggish fen where the
stream becomes tortuous and much divided. There the Entwash flows in by
many mouths from the Forest of Fangorn in the west. About that stream, on this
side of the Great River, lies Rohan. On the further side are the bleak hills
of the Emyn Muil. The wind blows from the East there, for they look out over
the Dead Marshes and the Noman-lands to Cirith Gorgor and the black gates of
Mordor. 'Boromir, and any that go with him seeking Minas Tirith, will do well
to leave the Great River above Rauros and cross the Entwash before it finds
the marshes. Yet they should not go too far up that stream, nor risk
becoming entangled in the Forest of Fangorn. That is a strange land, and is
now little known. But Boromir and Aragorn doubtless do not need this
warning.' 'Indeed we have heard of Fangorn in Minas Tirith,' said Boromir. 'But
what I have heard seems to me for the most part old wives' tales, such as we
tell to our children. All that lies north of Rohan is now to us so far away
that fancy can wander freely there. Of old Fangorn lay upon the borders of
our realm; but it is now many lives of men since any of us visited it, to
prove or disprove the legends that have come down from distant years. 'I have myself been at whiles in Rohan, but I have never crossed it
northwards. When I was sent out as a messenger, I passed through the Gap by
the skirts of the White Mountains, and crossed the Isen and the Grey flood
into Northerland. A long and wearisome journey. Four hundred leagues I
reckoned it, and it took me many months; for I lost my horse at Tharbad, at
the fording of the Greyflood. After that journey, and the road I have
trodden with this Company, I do not much doubt that I shall find a way
through Rohan, and Fangorn too, if need be.' 'Then I need say no more,' said Celeborn. 'But do not despise the lore
that has come down from distant years; for oft it may chance that old wives
keep in memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know.' Now Galadriel rose from the grass, and taking a cup from one of her
maidens she filled it with white mead and gave it to Celeborn. 'Now it is time to drink the cup of farewell,' she said. 'Drink, Lord
of the Galadhrim! And let not your heart be sad though night must follow
noon, and already our evening draweth nigh.’ Then she brought the cup to each of the Company, and bade them drink
and farewell. But when they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the
grass, and chairs were set for her and for Celeborn. Her maidens stood
silent about her, and a while she looked upon her guests. At last she spoke
again. 'We have drunk the cup of parting,' she said, 'and the shadows fall
between us. But before you go, I have brought in my ship gifts which the
Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim now offer you in memory of Lothlurien.' Then she called to each in turn. 'Here is the gift of Celeborn and Galadriel to the leader of your
Company,' she said to Aragorn, and she gave him a sheath that had been made
to fit his sword. It was overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves
wrought of silver and gold, and on it were set in elven runes formed of many
gems the name And®ril and the lineage of the sword. 'The blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or
broken even in defeat,' she said. 'But is there aught else that you desire
of me at our parting? For darkness will flow between us, and it may be that
we shall not meet again, unless it be far hence upon a road that has no
returning.’ And Aragorn answered: 'Lady, you know all my desire, and long held in
keeping the only treasure that I seek. Yet it is not yours to give me, even
if you would; and only through darkness shall I come to it.' 'Yet maybe this will lighten your heart,' said Galadriel; 'for it was
left in my care to be given to you, should you pass through this land.’ Then
she lifted from her lap a great stone of a clear green, set in a silver
brooch that was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with outspread wings;
and as she held it up the gem flashed like the sun shining through the
leaves of spring. 'This stone I gave to Celebrnan my daughter, and she to
hers; and now it comes to you as a token of hope. In this hour take the name
that was foretold for you, Elessar, the Elfstone of the house of Elendil! ’ Then Aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon his breast, and
those who saw him wondered; for they had not marked before how tall and
kingly he stood, and it seemed to them that many years of toil had fallen
from his shoulders. 'For the gifts that you have given me I thank you,’ he
said, 'O Lady of Lurien of whom were sprung Celebrnan and Arwen
Evenstar. What praise could I say more? ' The Lady bowed her head, and she turned then to Boromir, and to him she
gave a belt of gold; and to Merry and Pippin she gave small silver belts,
each with a clasp wrought like a golden flower. To Legolas she gave a bow
such as the Galadhrim used, longer and stouter than the bows of Mirkwood,
and strung with a string of elf-hair. With it went a quiver of arrows. 'For you little gardener and lover of trees,' she said to Sam, 'I have
only a small gift.’ She put into his hand a little box of plain grey wood,
unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid. 'Here is set G for
Galadriel,' she said; 'but also it may stand for garden in your tongue. In
this box there is earth from my orchard, and such blessing as Galadriel has
still to bestow is upon it. It will not keep you on your road, nor defend
you against any peril; but if you keep it and see your home again at last,
then perhaps it may reward you. Though you should find all barren and laid
waste, there will be few gardens in Middle-earth that will bloom like your
garden, if you sprinkle this earth there. Then you may remember Galadriel,
and catch a glimpse far off of Lurien, that you have seen only in our
winter. For our spring and our summer are gone by, and they will never be
seen on earth again save in memory.' Sam went red to the ears and muttered something inaudible, as he
clutched the box and bowed as well as he could. 'And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves? ' said Galadriel turning
to Gimli. 'None, Lady,’ answered Gimli. 'It is enough for me to have seen the
Lady of the Galadhrim, and to have heard her gentle words.' 'Hear all ye Elves! ’ she cried to those about her. 'Let none say again
that Dwarves are grasping and ungracious! Yet surely, Gimli son of Gluin,
you desire something that I could give? Name it, I bid you! You shall not be
the only guest without a gift.' 'There is nothing, Lady Galadriel,' said Gimli, bowing low and
stammering. 'Nothing, unless it might be-unless it is permitted to ask. nay,
to name a single strand of your hair, which surpasses the gold of the earth
as the stars surpass the gems of the mine. I do not ask for such a gift. But
you commanded me to name my desire.’ The Elves stirred and murmured with astonishment, and Celeborn gazed at
the Dwarf in wonder, but the Lady smiled. ’It is said that the skill of the
Dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues ’ she said; 'yet that
is not true of Gimli. For none have ever made to me a request so bold and
yet so courteous. And how shall I refuse, since I commanded him to speak?
But tell me, what would you do with such a gift? ’ 'Treasure it, Lady,’ he answered, 'in memory of your words to me at our
first meeting. And if ever I return to the smithies of my home, it shall be
set in imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of my house, and a pledge of
good will between the Mountain and the Wood until the end of days.’ Then the Lady unbraided one of her long tresses, and cut off three
golden hairs, and laid them in Gimli’s hand. 'These words shall go with the
gift,’ she said. 'I do not foretell, for all foretelling is now vain: on the
one hand lies darkness, and on the other only hope. But if hope should not
fail, then I say to you, Gimli son of Gluin, that your hands shall flow with
gold, and yet over you gold shall have no dominion. 'And you, Ring-bearer,’ she said, turning to Frodo. 'I come to you last
who are not last in my thoughts. For you I have prepared this.’ She held up
a small crystal phial: it glittered as she moved it, and rays of white light
sprang from her hand. ’In this phial,’ she said, 'is caught the light of
Edrendil’s star, set amid the waters of my fountain. It will shine still
brighter when night is about you. May it be a light to you in dark places,
when all other lights go out. Remember Galadriel and her Mirror! ’ Frodo took the phial, and for a moment as it shone between them, he saw
her again standing like a queen, great and beautiful, but no longer
terrible. He bowed, but found no words to say. Now the Lady arose, and Celeborn led them back to the hythe. A yellow
noon lay on the green land of the Tongue, and the water glittered with
silver. All at last was made ready. The Company took their places in the
boats as before. Crying farewell, the Elves of Lurien with long grey poles
thrust them out into the flowing stream, and the rippling waters bore them
slowly away. The travellers sat still without moving or speaking. On the
green bank near to the very point of the Tongue the Lady Galadriel stood
alone and silent. As they passed her they turned and their eyes watched her
slowly floating away from them. For so it seemed to them: Lurien was
slipping backward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees, sailing
on to forgotten shores, while they sat helpless upon the margin of the grey
and leafless world. Even as they gazed, the Silverlode passed out into the currents of the
Great River, and their boats turned and began to speed southwards. Soon the
white form of the Lady was small and distant. She shone like a window of
glass upon a far hill in the westering sun, or as a remote lake seen from a
mountain: a crystal fallen in the lap of the land. Then it seemed to Frodo
that she lifted her arms in a final farewell, and far but piercing-clear on
the following wind came the sound of her voice singing. But now she sang in
the ancient tongue of the Elves beyond the Sea, and he did not understand
the words: fair was the music, but it did not comfort him. Yet as is the way of Elvish words, they remained graven in his memory,
and long afterwards he interpreted them, as well as he could: the language
was that of Elven-song and spoke of things little known on Middle-earth. Ai! lauril lantar lassi s®rinen, Yjni ®nutiml ve rbmar aldaron! Yjni ve lintl yuldar avbnier

Nambril! Nai hiruvalyl Valimar. Nai elyl hiruva. Nambril! 'Ah! like gold fall the leaves in the wind, long years numberless as
the wings of trees ! The long years have passed like swift draughts of the
sweet mead in lofty halls beyond the West, beneath the blue vaults of Varda
wherein the stars tremble in the song of her voice, holy and queenly. Who
now shall refill the cup for me? For now the Kindler, Varda, the Queen of
the Stars, from Mount Everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds, and all
paths are drowned deep in shadow; and out of a grey country darkness lies on
the foaming waves between us, and mist covers the jewels of Calacirya for
ever. Now lost, lost to those from the East is Valimar! Farewell! Maybe thou
shalt find Valimar. Maybe even thou shalt find it. Farewell! ' Varda is the
name of that Fady whom the Elves in these lands of exile name Elbereth. Suddenly the River swept round a bend, and the banks rose upon either
side, and the light of Furien was hidden. To that fair land Frodo never came
again. The travellers now turned their faces to the journey; the sun was
before them, and their eyes were dazzled, for all were filled with tears. Gimli wept openly. 'I have looked the last upon that which was fairest,' he said to
Fegolas his companion. 'Henceforward I will call nothing fair, unless it be
her gift.' He put his hand to his breast. 'Tell me, Fegolas, why did I come on this Quest? Tittle did I know
where the chief peril lay! Truly Elrond spoke, saying that we could not
foresee what we might meet upon our road. Torment in the dark was the danger
that I feared, and it did not hold me back. But I would not have come, had I
known the danger of light and joy. Now I have taken my worst wound in this
parting, even if I were to go this night straight to the Dark Ford. Alas for
Gimli son of Gluin! ’ 'Nay! ’ said Fegolas. 'Alas for us all! And for all that walk the world
in these after-days. For such is the way of it: to find and lose, as it
seems to those whose boat is on the running stream. But I count you blessed,
Gimli son of Gluin: for your loss you suffer of your own free will, and you
might have chosen otherwise. But you have not forsaken your companions,
and the least reward that you shall have is that the memory of Fothlurien shall
remain ever clear and unstained in your heart, and shall neither fade nor
grow stale.' 'Maybe,' said Gimli; 'and I thank you for your words. True words
doubtless; yet all such comfort is cold. Memory is not what the heart
desires. That is only a mirror, be it clear as Kheled-zvram. Or so says the
heart of Gimli the Dwarf. Elves may see things otherwise. Indeed I have
heard that for them memory is more like to the waking world than to a dream.
Not so for Dwarves. 'But let us talk no more of it. Look to the boat! She is too low in the
water with all this baggage, and the Great River is swift. I do not wish to
drown my grief in cold water.' He took up a paddle, and steered towards the
western bank, following Aragorn's boat ahead, which had already moved out of
the middle stream. So the Company went on their long way, down the wide hurrying waters,
borne ever southwards. Bare woods stalked along either bank, and they could
not see any glimpse of the lands behind. The breeze died away and the River
flowed without a sound. No voice of bird broke the silence. The sun grew
misty as the day grew old, until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white
pearl. Then it faded into the West, and dusk came early, followed by a grey
and starless night. Far into the dark quiet hours they floated on, guiding
their boats under the overhanging shadows of the western woods. Great trees
passed by like ghosts, thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through the
mist down into the water. It was dreary and cold. Frodo sat and listened to
the faint lap and gurgle of the River fretting among the tree-roots and
driftwood near the shore, until his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy
sleep.
