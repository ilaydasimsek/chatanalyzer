 But we must take master
away from the wicked lights, yes, yes, we must.' With these words he started
off again, almost at a trot, down what appeared to be a long lane between
high reeds, and they stumbled after him as quickly as they could. But in a
little while he stopped suddenly and sniffed the air doubtfully, hissing as
if he was troubled or displeased again. 'What is it? ' growled Sam, misinterpreting the signs. 'What's the need
to sniff? The stink nearly knocks me down with my nose held. You stink, and
master stinks; the whole place stinks.' 'Yes, yes, and Sam stinks! ' answered Gollum. 'Poor Smjagol smells it,
but good Smjagol bears it. Helps nice master. But that's no matter. The
air’s moving, change is coming. Smjagol wonders; he's not happy.' He went on again, but his uneasiness grew, and every now and again he
stood up to his full height, craning his neck eastward and southward. For
some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him. Then
suddenly all three halted, stiffening and listening. To Frodo and Sam it
seemed that they heard, far away, a long wailing cry, high and thin and
cruel. They shivered. At the same moment the stirring of the air became
perceptible to them; and it grew very cold. As they stood straining their
ears, they heard a noise like a wind coming in the distance. The misty
lights wavered, dimmed, and went out. Gollum would not move. He stood shaking and gibbering to himself, until
with a rush the wind came upon them, hissing and snarling over the marshes.
The night became less dark, light enough for them to see, or half see,
shapeless drifts of fog, curling and twisting as it rolled over them and
passed them. Looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding; and then
high in the south the moon glimmered out, riding in the flying wrack. For a moment the sight of it gladdened the hearts of the hobbits; but
Gollum cowered down, muttering curses on the White Face. Then Frodo and
Sam staring at the sky, breathing deeply of the fresher air, saw it come: a
small cloud flying from the accursed hills; a black shadow loosed from
Mordor; a vast shape winged and ominous. It scudded across the moon, and
with a deadly cry went away westward, outrunning the wind in its fell speed. They fell forward, grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth. But the
shadow of horror wheeled and returned, passing lower now, right above them,
sweeping the fen-reek with its ghastly wings. And then it was gone, flying
back to Mordor with the speed of the wrath of Sauron; and behind it the wind
roared away, leaving the Dead Marshes bare and bleak. The naked waste, as
far as the eye could pierce, even to the distant menace of the mountains,
was dappled with the fitful moonlight. Frodo and Sam got up, rubbing their eyes, like children wakened from an
evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world. But Gollum lay
on the ground as if he had been stunned. They roused him with difficulty,
and for some time he would not lift his face, but knelt forward on his
elbows, covering the back of his head with his large flat hands. 'Wraiths!' he wailed. 'Wraiths on wings! The Precious is their master.
They see everything, everything. Nothing can hide from them. Curse the White
Face! And they tell Him everything. He sees, He knows. Ach, gollum, gollum,
golluml ' It was not until the moon had sunk, westering far beyond Tol
Brandir, that he would get up or make a move. From that time on Sam thought that he sensed a change in Gollum again. He was more fawning and would-be friendly; but Sam surprised some strange
looks in his eyes at times, especially towards Frodo; and he went back more
and more into his old manner of speaking. And Sam had another growing
anxiety. Frodo seemed to be weary, weary to the point of exhaustion. He said
nothing, indeed he hardly spoke at all; and he did not complain, but he
walked like one who carries a load, the weight of which is ever increasing;
and he dragged along, slower and slower, so that Sam had often to beg Gollum
to wait and not to leave their master behind. In fact with every step towards the gates of Mordor Frodo felt the Ring
on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome. He was now beginning to
feel it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards. But far more he was
troubled by the Eye: so he called it to himself. It was that more than the
drag of the Ring that made him cower and stoop as he walked. The Eye: that
horrible growing sense of a hostile will that strove with great power to
pierce all shadows of cloud, and earth, and flesh, and to see you: to pin
you under its deadly gaze, naked, immovable. So thin, so frail and thin, the
veils were become that still warded it off. Frodo knew just where the
present habitation and heart of that will now was: as certainly as a man can
tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut. He was facing it, and its
potency beat upon his brow. Gollum probably felt something of the same sort. But what went on in
his wretched heart between the pressure of the Eye, and the lust of the Ring
that was so near, and his grovelling promise made half in the fear of cold
iron, the hobbits did not guess: Frodo gave no thought to it. Sam's mind was
occupied mostly with his master hardly noticing the dark cloud that had
fallen on his own heart. He put Frodo in front of him now, and kept a
watchful eye on every movement of his, supporting him if he stumbled, and
trying to encourage him with clumsy words. When day came at last the hobbits were surprised to see how much closer
the ominous mountains had already drawn. The air was now clearer and colder,
and though still far off, the walls of Mordor were no longer a cloudy menace
on the edge of sight, but as grim black towers they frowned across a dismal
waste. The marshes were at an end, dying away into dead peats and wide flats
of dry cracked mud. The land ahead rose in long shallow slopes, barren and
pitiless, towards the desert that lay at Sauron’s gate. While the grey light lasted, they cowered under a black stone like
worms, shrinking, lest the winged terror should pass and spy them with its
cruel eyes. The remainder of that journey was a shadow of growing fear in
which memory could find nothing to rest upon. For two more nights they
struggled on through the weary pathless land. The air, as it seemed to them,
grew harsh, and filled with a bitter reek that caught their breath and
parched their mouths. At last, on the fifth morning since they took the road with Gollum,
they halted once more. Before them dark in the dawn the great mountains
reached up to roofs of smoke and cloud. Out from their feet were flung huge
buttresses and broken hills that were now at the nearest scarce a dozen
miles away. Frodo looked round in horror. Dreadful as the Dead Marshes had
been, and the arid moors of the Noman-lands, more loathsome far was the
country that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes.
Even to the Mere of Dead Faces some haggard phantom of green spring
would come; but here neither spring nor summer would ever come again. Here
nothing lived, not even the leprous growths that feed on rottenness. The gasping
pools were choked with ash and crawling muds, sickly white and grey, as if
the mountains had vomited the filth of their entrails upon the lands about. High mounds of crushed and powdered rock, great cones of earth fire-blasted
and poison-stained, stood like an obscene graveyard in endless rows, slowly
revealed in the reluctant light. They had come to the desolation that lay before Mordor: the lasting
monument to the dark labour of its slaves that should endure when all their
purposes were made void; a land defiled, diseased beyond all healing —
unless the Great Sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion. V I feel
sick,’ said Sam. Frodo did not speak. For a while they stood there, like men on the edge of a sleep where
nightmare lurks, holding it off, though they know that they can only come to
morning through the shadows. The light broadened and hardened. The
gasping pits and poisonous mounds grew hideously clear. The sun was up, walking
among clouds and long flags of smoke, but even the sunlight was defiled. The
hobbits had no welcome for that light; unfriendly it seemed, revealing them
in their helplessness — little squeaking ghosts that wandered among the
ash-heaps of the Dark Lord. Too weary to go further they sought for some place where they could
rest. For a while they sat without speaking under the shadow of a mound of
slag; but foul fumes leaked out of it, catching their throats and choking
them. Gollum was the first to get up. Spluttering and cursing he rose, and
without a word or a glance at the hobbits he crawled away on all fours.
Frodo and Sam crawled after him, until they came to a wide almost circular
pit, high-banked upon the west. It was cold and dead, and a foul sump of
oily many-coloured ooze lay at its bottom. In this evil hole they cowered,
hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the Eye. The day passed slowly. A great thirst troubled them, but they drank
only a few drops from their bottles-last filled in the gully, which now as
they looked back in thought seemed to them a place of peace and beauty. The
hobbits took it in turn to watch. At first, tired as they were, neither of
them could sleep at all; but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow
moving cloud, Sam dozed. It was Frodo's turn to be on guard. He lay back on
the slope of the pit, but that did not ease the sense of burden that was on
him. He looked up at the smoke-streaked sky and saw strange phantoms, dark
riding shapes, and faces out of the past. He lost count of time, hovering
between sleep and waking, until forgetfulness came over him. Suddenly Sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling. It was
evening. Frodo could not have called, for he had fallen asleep, and had slid
down nearly to the bottom of the pit. Gollum was by him. For a moment Sam
thought that he was trying to rouse Frodo; then he saw that it was not so.
Gollum was talking to himself. Smjagol was holding a debate with some other
thought that used the same voice but made it squeak and hiss. A pale light
and a green light alternated in his eyes as he spoke. 'Smjagol promised,’ said the first thought. 'Yes, yes, my precious,’ came the answer, ’we promised: to save our
Precious, not to let Him have it — never. But it’s going to Him yes, nearer
every step. What’s the hobbit going to do with it, we wonders, yes we
wonders.’ 'I don’t know. I can’t help it. Master’s got it. Smjagol promised to
help the master.’
'Yes, yes, to help the master: the master of the Precious. But if we
was master, then we could help ourself s, yes, and still keep promises.' 'But Smjagol said he would be very very good. Nice hobbit! He took
cruel rope off Smjagol's leg. He speaks nicely to me.' 'Very very good, eh, my precious? Let's be good, good as fish, sweet
one, but to ourselfs. Not hurt the nice hobbit, of course, no, no.' 'But the Precious holds the promise,’ the voice of Smjagol objected. 'Then take it,' said the other, 'and let's hold it ourselfs! Then we
shall be master, golluml Make the other hobbit, the nasty suspicious hobbit,
make him crawl, yes, golluml' 'But not the nice hobbit? ’ 'Oh no, not if it doesn't please us. Still he's a Baggins, my precious,
yes, a Baggins. A Baggins stole it. He found it and he said nothing,
nothing. We hates Bagginses.' 'No, not this Baggins.' 'Yes, every Baggins. All peoples that keep the Precious. We must have
it! ' 'But He'll see, He'll know. He'll take it from us! ' 'He sees. He knows. He heard us make silly promises — against His
orders, yes. Must take it. The Wraiths are searching. Must take it.' 'Not for Him! ' 'No, sweet one. See, my precious: if we has it, then we can escape,
even from Him, eh? Perhaps we grows very strong, stronger than Wraiths. Lord
Smjagol? Gollum the Great? The Gollum! Eat fish every day, three times a
day; fresh from the sea. Most Precious Gollum! Must have it. We wants it, we
wants it, we wants it! ' 'But there's two of them. They'll wake too quick and kill us,' whined
Smjagol in a last effort. 'Not now. Not yet.’ 'We wants it! But' — and here there was a long pause, as if a new
thought had wakened. 'Not yet, eh? Perhaps not. She might help. She might,
yes.’ 'No, no! Not that way! ' wailed Smjagol. 'Yes! We wants it! We wants it! ’ Each time that the second thought spoke, Gollum's long hand crept out
slowly, pawing towards Frodo, and then was drawn back with a jerk as
Smjagol spoke again. Finally both arms, with long fingers flexed and twitching,
clawed towards his neck. Sam had lain still, fascinated by this debate, but watching every move
that Gollum made from under his half-closed eye-lids. To his simple mind
ordinary hunger, the desire to eat hobbits, had seemed the chief danger in
Gollum. He realized now that it was not so: Gollum was feeling the terrible
call of the Ring. The Dark Lord was He, of course; but Sam wondered who
She was. One of the nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings,
he supposed. Then he forgot the point, for things had plainly gone far
enough, and were getting dangerous. A great heaviness was in all his limbs,
but he roused himself with an effort and sat up. Something warned him to be
careful and not to reveal that he had overheard the debate. He let out a
loud sigh and gave a huge yawn. 'What's the time? ' he said sleepily. Gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth. He stood up for a
moment, tense and menacing; and then he collapsed, falling forward on to all
fours and crawling up the bank of the pit. 'Nice hobbits! Nice Sam! ' he
said. 'Sleepy heads, yes, sleepy heads! Leave good Smjagol to watch! But
it's evening. Dusk is creeping. Time to go.' 'High time! ' thought Sam. 'And time we parted, too.' Yet it crossed
his mind to wonder if indeed Gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as
kept with them. 'Curse him! I wish he was choked!' he muttered. He stumbled
down the bank and roused his master. Strangely enough, Frodo felt refreshed. He had been dreaming. The dark
shadow had passed, and a fair vision had visited him in this land of
disease. Nothing remained of it in his memory, yet because of it he felt
glad and lighter of heart. His burden was less heavy on him. Gollum welcomed
him with dog-like delight. He chuckled and chattered, cracking his long
fingers, and pawing at Frodo's knees. Frodo smiled at him. 'Come! ' he said. 'You have guided us well and faithfully. This is the
last stage. Bring us to the Gate, and then I will not ask you to go further. Bring us to the Gate, and you may go where you wish — only not to our
enemies.' 'To the Gate, eh?' Gollum squeaked, seeming surprised and frightened. 'To the Gate, master says! Yes, he says so. And good Smjagol does what he
asks, O yes. But when we gets closer, we'll see perhaps we'll see then. It
won't look nice at all. O no! O no!'
’Go on with you! ' said Sam. 'Let's get it over! ' In the falling dusk they scrambled out of the pit and slowly threaded
their way through the dead land. They had not gone far before they felt once
more the fear that had fallen on them when the winged shape swept over the
marshes. They halted, cowering on the evil-smelling ground; but they saw
nothing in the gloomy evening sky above, and soon the menace passed, high
overhead, going maybe on some swift errand from Barad-dyr. After a while
Gollum got up and crept forward again, muttering and shaking. About an hour after midnight the fear fell on them a third time, but it
now seemed more remote, as if it were passing far above the clouds, rushing
with terrible speed into the West. Gollum, however, was helpless with
terror, and was convinced that they were being hunted, that their approach
was known. 'Three times! ' he whimpered. 'Three times is a threat. They feel us
here, they feel the Precious. The Precious is their master. We cannot go any
further this way, no. It's no use, no use! ' Pleading and kind words were no longer of any avail. It was not until
Frodo commanded him angrily and laid a hand on his sword-hilt that Gollum
would get up again. Then at last he rose with a snarl, and went before them
like a beaten dog. So they stumbled on through the weary end of the night, and until the
coming of another day of fear they walked in silence with bowed heads,
seeing nothing, and hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears.
Chapter 3 . The Black Gate is Closed Before the next day dawned their journey to Mordor was over. The
marshes and the desert were behind them. Before them, darkling against a
pallid sky, the great mountains reared their threatening heads. Upon the west of Mordor marched the gloomy range of Ephel D®ath, the
Mountains of Shadow, and upon the north the broken peaks and barren ridges
of Ered Lithui, grey as ash. But as these ranges approached one another,
being indeed but parts of one great wall about the mournful plains of
Lithlad and of Gorgoroth, and the bitter inland sea of N® men amidmost, they
swung out long arms northward; and between these arms there was a deep
defile. This was Cirith Gorgor, the Haunted Pass, the entrance to the land
of the Enemy. High cliffs lowered upon either side, and thrust forward from
its mouth were two sheer hills, black -boned and bare. Upon them stood the
Teeth of Mordor, two towers strong and tall. In days long past they were
built by the Men of Gondor in their pride and power, after the overthrow of
Sauron and his flight, lest he should seek to return to his old realm. But
the strength of Gondor failed, and men slept, and for long years the towers
stood empty. Then Sauron returned. Now the watch-towers, which had fallen
into decay, were repaired, and filled with arms, and garrisoned with
ceaseless vigilance. Stony -faced they were, with dark window-holes staring
north and east and west, and each window was full of sleepless eyes. Across the mouth of the pass, from cliff to cliff, the Dark Lord had
built a rampart of stone. In it there was a single gate of iron, and upon
its battlement sentinels paced unceasingly. Beneath the hills on either side
the rock was bored into a hundred caves and maggot-holes: there a host of
ores lurked, ready at a signal to issue forth like black ants going to war. None could pass the Teeth of Mordor and not feel their bite, unless they
were summoned by Sauron, or knew the secret passwords that would open
the Morannon, the black gate of his land. The two hobbits gazed at the towers and the wall in despair. Even from
a distance they could see in the dim light the movement of the black guards
upon the wall, and the patrols before the gate. They lay now peering over
the edge of a rocky hollow beneath the out-stretched shadow of the northmost
buttress of Ephel D®ath. Winging the heavy air in a straight flight a crow,
maybe, would have flown but a furlong from their hiding-place to the black
summit of the nearer tower. A faint smoke curled above it, as if fire
smouldered in the hill beneath. Day came, and the fallow sun blinked over the lifeless ridges of Ered
Lithui. Then suddenly the cry of brazen-throated trumpets was heard: from
the watch-towers they blared, and far away from hidden holds and outposts in
the hills came answering calls; and further still, remote but deep and
ominous, there echoed in the hollow land beyond the mighty horns and drums
of Barad-dyr. Another dreadful day of fear and toil had come to Mordor; and
the night-guards were summoned to their dungeons and deep halls, and the
day-guards, evil-eyed and fell, were marching to their posts. Steel gleamed
dimly on the battlement. 'Well, here we are! ' said Sam. 'Here’s the Gate, and it looks to me as
if that’s about as far as we are ever going to get. My word, but the Gaffer
would have a thing or two to say, if he saw me now! Often said I’d come to a
bad end, if I didn't watch my step, he did. But now I don't suppose I'll
ever see the old fellow again. He'll miss his chance of I told'ee so, Sam:
more's the pity. He could go on telling me as long as he'd got breath, if
only I could see his old face again. But I'd have to get a wash first, or he
wouldn't know me. 'I suppose it's no good asking "what way do we go now?" We can't go no
further -unless we want to ask the ores for a lift.' 'No, no! ' said Gollum. 'No use. We can't go further. Smjagol said so. He said: we'll go to the Gate, and then we'll see. And we do see. O yes. my
precious, we do see. Smjagol knew hobbits could not go this way. O yes.
Smjagol knew ' 'Then what the plague did you bring us here for? ' said Sam, not
feeling in the mood to be just or reasonable. 'Master said so. Master says: Bring us to the Gate. So good Smjagol
does so. Master said so, wise master.' 'I did,' said Frodo. His face was grim and set. but resolute. He was
filthy, haggard, and pinched with weariness, but he cowered no longer, and
his eyes were clear. 'I said so, because I purpose to enter Mordor, and I
know no other way. Therefore I shall go this way. I do not ask anyone to go
with me.’ 'No, no, master! ' wailed Gollum; pawing at him, and seeming in great
distress. 'No use that way! No use! Don’t take the Precious to Him! He'll
eat us all, if He gets it, eat all the world. Keep it, nice master, and be
kind to Smjagol. Don’t let Him have it. Or go away, go to nice places, and
give it back to little Smjagol. Yes, yes, master: give it back, eh? Smjagol
will keep it safe; he will do lots of good, especially to nice hobbits. Hobbits go home. Don’t go to the Gate! ’ 'I am commanded to go to the land of Mordor, and therefore I shall go,’
said Frodo. 'If there is only one way, then I must take it. What comes after
must come.' Sam said nothing. The look on Frodo's face was enough for him he knew
that words of his were useless. And after all he never had any real hope in
the affair from the beginning; but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed
hope, as long as despair could be postponed. Now they were come to the
bitter end. But he had stuck to his master all the way; that was what he had
chiefly come for, and he would still stick to him. His master would not go
to Mordor alone. Sam would go with him-and at any rate they would get rid of
Gollum. Gollum, however, did not intend to be got rid of, yet. He knelt at
Frodo's feet, wringing his hands and squeaking. 'Not this way, master! ' he
pleaded, 'There is another way. O yes indeed there is. Another way. darker,
more difficult to find, more secret. But Smjagol knows it. Let Smjagol show
you! ' 'Another way! ' said Frodo doubtfully, looking down at Gollum with
searching eyes. 'Yess! Yess indeed! There was another way. Smjagol found it. Let's go
and see if it's still there! ' 'You have not spoken of this before.’ 'No. Master did not ask. Master did not say what he meant to do. He
does not tell poor Smjagol. He says: Smjagol, take me to the Gate — and
then good bye! Smjagol can run away and be good. But now he says: I purpose
to enter Mordor this way. So Smjagol is very afraid. He does not want to
lose nice master. And he promised, master made him promise, to save the
Precious. But master is going to take it to Him, straight to the Black Hand,
if master will go this way. So Smjagol must save them both, and he thinks of
another way that there was, once upon a time. Nice master. Smjagol very
good, always helps.' Sam frowned. If he could have bored holes in Gollum with his eyes, he
would have done. His mind was full of doubt. To all appearances Gollum was
genuinely distressed and anxious to help Frodo. But Sam, remembering the
overheard debate, found it hard to believe that the long submerged Smjagol
had come out on top: that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the
debate. Sam's guess was that the Smjagol and Gollum halves (or what in his
own mind he called Slinker and Stinker) had made a truce and a temporary
alliance: neither wanted the Enemy to get the Ring; both wished to keep
Frodo from capture, and under their eye, as long as possible — at any rate
as long as Stinker still had a chance of laying hands on his ’Precious'.
Whether there really was another way into Mordor Sam doubted. 'And it's a good thing neither half of the old villain don't know what
master means to do,' he thought. 'If he knew that Mr. Frodo is trying to put
an end to his Precious for good and all, there'd be trouble pretty quick, I
bet. Anyhow old Stinker is so frightened of the Enemy — and he's under
orders of some kind from him, or was — that he'd give us away rather than
be caught helping us; and rather than let his Precious be melted, maybe. At
least that's my idea. And I hope the master will think it out carefully. He's as wise as any, but he's soft-hearted, that's what he is. It's beyond
any Gamgee to guess what he'll do next.' Frodo did not answer Gollum at once. While these doubts were passing
through Sam's slow but shrewd mind, he stood gazing out towards the dark
cliff of Cirith Gorgor. The hollow in which they had taken refuge was delved
in the side of a low hill, at some little height above a long trenchlike
valley that lay between it and the outer buttresses of the mountains. In the
midst of the valley stood the black foundations of the western watch-tower. By morning -light the roads that converged upon the Gate of Mordor could
now be clearly seen, pale and dusty; one winding back northwards; another
dwindling eastwards into the mists that clung about the feet of Ered Lithui;
and a third that ran towards him. As it bent sharply round the tower, it
entered a narrow defile and passed not far below the hollow where he stood.
Westward, to his right, it turned, skirting the shoulders of the mountains,
and went off southwards into the deep shadows that mantled all the western
sides of Ephel D®ath; beyond his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land
between the mountains and the Great River. As he gazed Frodo became aware that there was a great stir and movement
on the plain. It seemed as if whole armies were on the march, though for the
most part they were hidden by the reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and
wastes beyond. But here and there he caught the gleam of spears and helmets;
and over the levels beside the roads horsemen could be seen riding in many
companies. He remembered his vision from afar upon Amon Hen, so few
days before, though now it seemed many years ago. Then he knew that the hope that
had for one wild moment stirred in his heart was vain. The trumpets had not
rung in challenge but in greeting. This was no assault upon the Dark Lord by
the men of Gondor, risen like avenging ghosts from the graves of valour long
passed away. These were Men of other race, out of the wide Eastlands,
gathering to the summons of their Overlord; armies that had encamped before
his Gate by night and now marched in to swell his mounting power. As if
suddenly made fully aware of the peril of their position, alone, in the
growing light of day, so near to this vast menace, Frodo quickly drew his
frail grey hood close upon his head, and stepped down into the dell. Then he
turned to Gollum. 'Smjagol,' he said, 'I will trust you once more. Indeed it seems that I
must do so, and that it is my fate to receive help from you. where I least
looked for it, and your fate to help me whom you long pursued with evil
purpose. So far you have deserved well of me and have kept your promise
truly. Truly, I say and mean,' he added with a glance at Sam, 'for twice now
we have been in your power, and you have done no harm to us. Nor have you
tried to take from me what you once sought. May the third time prove the
best! But I warn you, Smjagol, you are in danger.' 'Yes, yes, master! ' said Gollum. 'Dreadful danger! Smjagol's bones
shake to think of it. but he doesn't run away. He must help nice master.' 'I did not mean the danger that we all share,' said Frodo. 'I mean a
danger to yourself alone. You swore a promise by what you call the Precious.
Remember that! It will hold you to it; but it will seek a way to twist it to
your own undoing. Already you are being twisted. You revealed yourself to me
just now, foolishly. Give it back to Smjagol you said. Do not say that
again! Do not let that thought grow in you! You will never get it back. But
the desire of it may betray you to a bitter end. You will never get it back. In the last need, Smjagol, I should put on the Precious; and the Precious
mastered you long ago. If I, wearing it, were to command you, you would
obey, even if it were to leap from a precipice or to cast yourself into the
fire. And such would be my command. So have a care, Smjagol!'
Sam looked at his master with approval, but also with surprise: there
was a look in his face and a tone in his voice that he had not known before. It had always been a notion of his that the kindness of dear Mr. Frodo was
of such a high degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness. Of
course, he also firmly held the incompatible belief that Mr. Frodo was the
wisest person in the world (with the possible exception of Old Mr. Bilbo and
of Gandalf). Gollum in his own way, and with much more excuse as his
acquaintance was much briefer, may have _made a similar mistake, confusing
kindness and blindness. At any rate this speech abashed and terrified him. He grovelled on the ground and could speak no clear words but nice master. Frodo waited patiently for a while, then he spoke again less sternly. 'Come now, Gollum or Smjagol if you wish, tell me of this other way, and
show me, if you can, what hope there is in it, enough to justify me in
turning aside from my plain path. I am in haste.' But Gollum was in a pitiable state, and Frodo's threat had quite
unnerved him. It was not easy to get any clear account out of him, amid his
mumblings and squeakings, and the frequent interruptions in which he crawled
on the floor and begged them both to be kind to 'poor little Smjagol'. After
a while he grew a little calmer, and Frodo gathered bit by bit that, if a
traveller followed the road that turned west of Ephel D®ath, he would come
in time to a crossing in a circle of dark trees. On the right a road went
down to Osgiliath and the bridges of the Anduin; in the middle the road went
on southwards. 'On, on, on,' said Gollum. 'We never went that way, but they say it
goes a hundred leagues, until you can see the Great Water that is never
still. There are lots of fishes there, and big birds eat fishes: nice birds:
but we never went there, alas no! we never had a chance. And further still
there are more lands, they say, but the Yellow Face is very hot there, and
there are seldom any clouds, and the men are fierce and have dark faces. We
do not want to see that land.' 'No! ' said Frodo. 'But do not wander from your road. What of the third
turning? ’ 'O yes, O yes, there is a third way,' said Gollum. 'That is the road to
the left. At once it begins to climb up, up, winding and climbing back
towards the tall shadows. When it turns round the black rock, you'll see it.
suddenly you'll see it above you, and you'll want to hide.' 'See it, see it? What will you see? ’
'The old fortress, very old, very horrible now. We used to hear tales
from the South, when Smjagol was young, long ago. O yes. we used to tell
lots of tales in the evening, sitting by the banks of the Great River, in
the willow-lands, when the River was younger too, gollum, gollum.' He began
to weep and mutter. The hobbits waited patiently. 'Tales out of the South,’ Gollum went on again, 'about the tall Men
with the shining eyes, and their houses like hills of stone, and the silver
crown of their King and his White Tree: wonderful tales. They built very
tall towers, and one they raised was silver-white, and in it there was a
stone like the Moon, and round it were great white walls. O yes, there were
many tales about the Tower of the Moon.’ 'That would be Minas Ithil that Isildur the son of Elendil built ’ said
Frodo. 'It was Isildur who cut off the finger of the Enemy.’ 'Yes, He has only four on the Black Hand, but they are enough,’ said
Gollum shuddering. ’And He hated Isildur’ s city.’ ’What does he not hate? ’ said Frodo. ’But what has the Tower of the
Moon to do with us? ’ ’Well, master, there it was and there it is: the tall tower and the
white houses and the wall; but not nice now, not beautiful. He conquered it
long ago. It is a very terrible place now. Travellers shiver when they see
it, they creep out of sight, they avoid its shadow. But master will have to
go that way. That is the only other way, For the mountains are lower there,
and the old road goes up and up, until it reaches a dark pass at the top,
and then it goes down, down, again — to Gorgoroth.’ His voice sank to a
whisper and he shuddered. 'But how will that help us? ’ asked Sam. 'Surely the Enemy knows all
about his own mountains, and that road will be guarded as close as this? The
tower isn’t empty, is it? ’ 'O no, not empty! ’ whispered Gollum. 'It seems empty, but it isn’t, O
no! Very dreadful things live there. Ores, yes always Ores; but worse
things, worse things live there too. The road climbs right under the shadow
of the walls and passes the gate. Nothing moves on the road that they don’t
know about. The things inside know: the Silent Watchers.’ 'So that’s your advice is it,’ said Sam, ’that we should go another
long march south, to find ourselves in the same fix or a worse one, when we
get there, if we ever do? ’ 'No, no indeed,’ said Gollum. 'Hobbits must see, must try to
understand. He does not expect attack that way. His Eye is all round, but it
attends more to some places than to others. He can't see everything all at
once, not yet. You see, He has conquered all the country west of the Shadowy
Mountains down to the River, and He holds the bridges now. He thinks no one
can come to the Moontower without fighting big battle at the bridges, or
getting lots of boats which they cannot hide and He will know about.' 'You seem to know a lot about what He's doing and thinking,' said Sam.
'Have you been talking to Him lately? Or just hobnobbing with Ores? ' 'Not nice hobbit, not sensible,' said Gollum, giving Sam an angry
glance and turning to Frodo. 'Smjagol has talked to Ores, yes of course,
before he met master, and to many peoples: he has walked very far. And what
he says now many peoples are saying. It's here in the North that the big
danger is for Him, and for us. He will come out of the Black Gate one day,
one day soon. That is the only way big armies can come. But away down west
He is not afraid, and there are the Silent Watchers.' 'Just so! ' said Sam, not to be put off. 'And so we are to walk up and
knock at their gate and ask if we're on the right road for Mordor? Or are
they too silent to answer? It's not. sense. We might as well do it here, and
save ourselves a long tramp.' 'Don't make jokes about it,' hissed Gollum. 'It isn't funny, O no! Not
amusing. It's nut sense to try and get into Mordor at all. But if master
says I must go or I will go, then he must try some way. But he must not go
to the terrible city, O no, of course not. That is where Smjagol helps, nice
Smjagol. though no one tells him what it is all about. Smjagol helps again. He found it. He knows it.' 'What did you find? ' asked Frodo. Gollum crouched down and his voice sank to a whisper again. 'A little
path leading up into the mountains: and then a stair, a narrow stair, O yes,
very long and narrow. And then more stairs. And then' — his voice sank even
lower — 'a tunnel, a dark tunnel; and at last a little cleft, and a path
high above the main pass. It was that way that Smjagol got out of the
darkness. But it was years ago. The path may have vanished now; but perhaps
not, perhaps not.' 'I don't like the sound of it at all,' said Sam. 'Sounds too easy at
any rate in the telling. If that path is still there, it'll be guarded too. Wasn't it guarded, Gollum? ' As he said this, he caught or fancied he caught
a green gleam in Gollum' s eye. Gollum muttered but did not reply.
'Is it not guarded? ' asked Frodo sternly. 'And did you escape out of
the darkness, Smjagol? Were you not rather permitted to depart upon an
errand? That at least is w hat Aragorn thought, who found you by the Dead
Marshes some years ago.' 'It's a lie! ' hissed Gollum, and an evil light came into his eyes at
the naming of Aragorn. 'He lied on me, yes he did. I did escape, all by my
poor self. Indeed I was told to seek for the Precious; and I have searched
and searched, of course I have. But not for the Black One. The Precious was
ours, it was mine I tell you. I did escape.' Frodo felt a strange certainty that in this matter Gollum was for once
not so far from the truth as might be suspected; that he had somehow found a
way out of Mordor, and at least believed that it was by his own cunning. For
one thing, he noted that Gollum used I, and that seemed usually to be a
sign, on its rare appearances, that some remnants of old truth and sincerity
were for the moment on top. But even if Gollum could be trusted on this
point, Frodo did not forget the wiles of the Enemy. The 'escape' may have
been allowed or arranged, and well known in the Dark Tower. And in any case
Gollum was plainly keeping a good deal back. 'I ask you again,' he said: 'is not this secret way guarded? ’ But the name of Aragorn had put Gollum into a sullen mood. He had all
the injured air of a liar suspected when for once he has told the truth, or
part of it. He did not answer. 'Is it not guarded? ' Frodo repeated. 'Yes, yes, perhaps. No safe places in this country,' said Gollum
sulkily. 'No safe places. But master must try it or go home. . No other
way.' They could not get him to say more. The name of the perilous place and
the high pass he could not tell, or would not. Its name was Cirith Ungol, a name of dreadful rumour. Aragorn could
perhaps have told them that name and its significance: Gandalf would have
warned them. But they were alone, and Aragorn was far away, and Gandalf
stood amid the ruin of Isengard and strove with Saruman, delayed by treason.
Yet even as he spoke his last words to Saruman, and the palantnr crashed in
fire upon the steps of Orthanc. his thought was ever upon Frodo and Samwise,
over the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and pity. Maybe Frodo felt it, not knowing it, as he had upon Amon Hen, even
though he believed that Gandalf was gone, gone for ever into the shadow in
Moria far away. He sat upon the ground for a long while, silent, his head
bowed, striving to recall all that Gandalf had said to him. But for this
choice he could recall no counsel. Indeed Gandalf s guidance had been taken
from them too soon, too soon, while the Dark Land was still very far away.
How they should enter it at the last Gandalf had not said. Perhaps he could
not say. Into the stronghold of the Enemy in the North, into Dol Guldur, he
had once ventured. But into Mordor, to the Mountain of Fire and to
Barad-dyr, since the Dark Lord rose in power again, had he ever journeyed
there? Frodo did not think so. And here he was a little halfling from the
Shire, a simple hobbit of the quiet countryside expected to find a way where
the great ones could not go, or dared not go. It was an evil fate. But he
had taken it on himself in his own sitting-room in the far-off spring of
another year, so remote now that it was like a chapter in a story of the
world's youth, when the Trees of Silver and Gold were still in bloom. This
was an evil choice. Which way should he choose? And if both led to terror
and death, what good lay in choice? The day drew on. A deep silence fell upon the little grey hollow where
they lay, so near to the borders of the land of fear: a silence that could
be felt, as if it were a thick veil that cut them off from all the world
about them. Above them was a dome of pale sky barred with fleeting smoke,
but it seemed high and far away, as if seen through great deeps of air heavy
with brooding thought. Not even an eagle poised against the sun would have marked the hobbits
sitting there, under the weight of doom, silent, p not moving, shrouded in
their thin grey cloaks. For a moment he might have paused to consider
Gollum, a tiny figure sprawling on the ground: there perhaps lay the
famished skeleton of some child of Men, its ragged garment still clinging to
it, its long arms and legs almost bone -white and bone-thin: no flesh worth a
peck. Frodo’s head was bowed over his knees, but Sam leaned back, with hands
behind his head, staring out of his hood at the empty sky. At least for a
long while it was empty. Then presently Sam thought he saw a dark bird-like
figure wheel into the circle of his sight, and hover, and then wheel away
again. Two more followed, and then a fourth. They were very small to look
at, yet he knew, somehow, that they were huge, with a vast stretch of
pinion, flying at a great height. He covered his eyes and bent forward,
cowering. The same warning fear was on him as he had felt in the presence of
the Black Riders, the helpless horror that had come with the cry in the wind
and the shadow on the moon, though now it was not so crushing or compelling:
the menace was more remote. But menace it was. Frodo felt it too. His
thought was broken. He stirred and shivered, but he did not look up. Gollum
huddled himself together like a cornered spider. The winged shapes wheeled,
and stooped swiftly down, speeding back to Mordor. Sam took a deep breath. 'The Riders are about again, up in the air,' he
said in a hoarse whisper. 'I saw them. Do you think they could see us? They
were very high up. And if they are Black Riders same as before, then they
can’t see much by daylight, can they? ' 'No, perhaps not,' said Frodo. 'But their steeds could see. And these
winged creatures that they ride on now, they can probably see more than any
other creature. They are like great carrion birds. They are looking for
something: the Enemy is on the watch, I fear.’ The feeling of dread passed, but the enfolding silence was broken. For
some time they had been cut off from the world, as if in an invisible
island; now they were laid bare again, peril had returned. But still Frodo
did not speak to Gollum or make his choice. His eyes were closed, as if he
were dreaming, or looking inward into his heart and memory. At last he
stirred and stood up, and it seemed that he was about to speak and to
decide. But 'hark!' he said. 'What is that?’ A new fear was upon them. They heard singing and hoarse shouting. At
first it seemed a long way off, but it drew nearer: it was coming towards
them. It leaped into all their minds that the Black Wings had spied them and
had sent armed soldiers to seize them: no speed seemed too great for these
terrible servants of Sauron. They crouched, listening. The voices and the
clink of weapons and harness were very close. Frodo and Sam loosened their
small swords in their sheaths. Flight was impossible. Gollum rose slowly and crawled insect-like to the lip of the hollow. Very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch, until he could peer over it
between two broken points of stone. He remained there without moving for
some time, making no sound. Presently the voices began to recede again, and
then they slowly faded away. Far off a horn blew on the ramparts of the
Morannon. Then quietly Gollum drew back and slipped down into the hollow. ’More Men going to Mordor,’ he said in a low voice. 'Dark faces. We
have not seen Men like these before, no, Smjagol has not. They are fierce.
They have black eyes, and long black hair, and gold rings in their ears;
yes, lots of beautiful gold. And some have red paint on their cheeks, and
red cloaks; and their flags are red, and the tips of their spears; and they
have round shields, yellow and black with big spikes. Not nice; very cruel
wicked Men they look. Almost as bad as Ores, and much bigger. Smjagol
thinks they have come out of the South beyond the Great River's end: they came up
that road. They have passed on to the Black Gate; but more may follow.
Always more people coming to Mordor. One day all the peoples will be
inside.' 'Were there any oliphaunts?' asked Sam, forgetting his fear in his
eagerness for news of strange places. 'No, no oliphaunts. What are oliphaunts? ’ said Gollum. Sam stood up, putting his hands behind his back (as he always did when
'speaking poetry'), and began: Grey as a mouse, Big as a house. Nose like a snake, I make the earth shake, As I tramp through the grass; Trees crack as I pass. With horns in my mouth
I walk in the South, Flapping big ears. Beyond count of years
I stump round and round, Never lie on the ground, Not even to die. Oliphaunt am I, Biggest of all, Huge, old, and tall. If ever you'd met me
You wouldn 't forget me. If you never do, You won't think I'm true; But old Oliphaunt am I, And I never lie. 'That,' said Sam, when he had finished reciting, 'that's a rhyme we
have in the Shire. Nonsense maybe, and maybe not. But we have our tales too,
and news out of the South, you know. In the old days hobbits used to go on
their travels now and again. Not that many ever came back, and not that all
they said was believed: news from Bree , and not sure as Shiretalk, as the
sayings go. But I've heard tales of the big folk down away in the Sunlands.
Swertings we call ’em in our tales; and they ride on oliphaunts, 'tis said,
when they fight. They put houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs and
all, and the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees at one another. So when you
said "Men out of the South, all in red and gold;" I said "were there any
oliphaunts? " For if there was, I was going to take a look, risk or no. But
now I don't suppose I'll ever see an oliphaunt. Maybe there ain't no such a
beast.' He sighed. 'No, no oliphaunts,' said Gollum again. 'Smjagol has not heard of them. He does not want to see them. He does not want them to be. Smjagol wants to
go away from here and hide somewhere safer. Smjagol wants master to go.
Nice master, won't he come with Smjagol? ' Frodo stood up. He had laughed in the midst of all his cares when Sam
trotted out the old fireside rhyme of Oliphaunt , and the laugh had released
him from hesitation. 'I wish we had a thousand oliphaunts with Gandalf on a
white one at their head,' he said. 'Then we'd break a way into this evil
land, perhaps. But we've not; just our own tired legs, that's all. Well,
Smjagol, the third turn may turn the best. I will come with you.' 'Good master, wise master, nice master!' cried Gollum in delight,
patting Frodo's knees. 'Good master! Then rest now, nice hobbits, under the
shadow of the stones, close under the stones ! Rest and lie quiet, till the
Yellow Face goes away. Then we can go quickly. Soft and quick as shadows
we must be!’
Chapter 4 . Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit For the few hours of daylight that were left they rested, shifting into
the shade as the sun moved, until at last the shadow of the western rim of
their dell grew long, and darkness filled all the hollow. Then they ate a
little, and drank sparingly. Gollum ate nothing, but he accepted water
gladly. 'Soon get more now,' he said, licking his lips. 'Good water runs down
in streams to the Great River, nice water in the lands we are going to.
Smjagol will get food there too, perhaps. He's very hungry, yes, gollumV He
set his two large flat hands on his shrunken belly, and a pale green light
came into his eyes. The dusk was deep when at length they set out, creeping over the
westward rim of the dell, and fading like ghosts into the broken country on
the borders of the road: The moon was now three nights from the full, but it
did not climb over the mountains until nearly midnight, and the early night
was very dark. A single red light burned high up in the Towers of the Teeth,
but otherwise no sign could be seen or heard of the sleepless watch on the
Morannon. For many miles the red eye seemed to stare at them as they fled,
stumbling through a barren stony country. They did not dare to take the
road, but they kept it on their left, following its line as well as they
could at a little distance. At last, when night was growing old and they
were already weary, for they had taken only one short rest, the eye dwindled
to a small fiery point and then vanished: they had turned the dark northern
shoulder of the lower mountains and were heading southwards. With hearts strangely lightened they now rested again, but not for
long. They were not going quick enough for Gollum. By his reckoning it was
nearly thirty leagues from the Morannon to the cross-roads above Osgiliath,
and he hoped to cover that distance in four journeys. So soon they struggled
on once more, until the dawn began to spread slowly in the wide grey
solitude. They had then walked almost eight leagues; and the hobbits could
not have gone any further, even if they had dared. The growing light revealed to them a land already, less barren and
ruinous. The mountains still loomed up ominously on their left, but near at
hand they could see the southward road, now bearing away from the black
roots of the hills and slanting westwards. Beyond it were slopes covered
with sombre trees like dark clouds, but all about them lay a tumbled
heathland, grown with ling and broom and cornel, and other shrubs that they
did not know. Here and there they saw knots of tall pine-trees. The hearts
of the hobbits rose again a little in spite of weariness: the air was fresh
and fragrant, and it reminded them of the uplands of the Northfarthing far
away. It seemed good to be reprieved, to walk in a land that had only been
for a few years under the dominion of the Dark Lord and was not yet fallen
wholly into decay. But they did not forget their danger, nor the Black Gate
that was still all too near, hidden though it was behind the gloomy heights.
They looked about for a hiding-place where they could shelter from evil eyes
while the light lasted. The day passed uneasily. They lay deep in the heather and counted out
the slow hours, in which there seemed little change; for they were still
under the shadows of the Ephel D®ath, and the sun was veiled. Frodo slept at
times, deeply and peacefully, either trusting Gollum or too tired to trouble
about him; but Sam found it difficult to do more than doze, even when Gollum
was plainly fast asleep, whiffling and twitching in his secret dreams.
Hunger, perhaps, more than mistrust kept him wakeful: he had begun to long
for a good homely meal, 'something hot out of the pot'. As soon as the land faded into a formless grey under coming night, they
started out again. In a little while Gollum led them down on to the
southward road; and after that they went on more quickly, though the danger
was greater. Their ears were strained for the sound of hoof or foot on the
road ahead, or following them from behind; but the night passed, and they
heard no sound of walker or rider. The road had been made in a long lost time: and for perhaps thirty
miles below the Morannon it had been newly repaired, but as it went south
the wild encroached upon it. The handiwork of Men of old could still be seen
in its straight sure flight and level course: now and again it cut its way
through hillside slopes, or leaped over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of
enduring masonry; but at last all signs of stonework faded, save for a
broken pillar here and there, peering out of bushes at the side, or old
paving-stones still lurking amid weeds and moss. Heather and trees and
bracken scrambled down and overhung the banks, or sprawled out over the
surface. It dwindled at last to a country cart-road little used; but it did
not wind: it held on its own sure course and guided them by the swiftest
way. So they passed into the northern marches of that land that Men once
called Ithilien, a fair country of climbing woods and swift -falling streams. The night became fine under star and round moon, and it seemed to the
hobbits that the fragrance of the air grew as they went forward; and from
the blowing and muttering of Gollum it seemed that he noticed it too, and
did not relish it. At the first signs of day they halted again. They had
come to the end of a long cutting, deep, and sheer-sided in the middle, by
which the road clove its way through a stony ridge. Now they climbed up the
westward bank and looked abroad. Day was opening in the sky, and they saw that the mountains were now
much further off, receding eastward in a long curve that was lost in the
distance. Before them, as they turned west, gentle slopes ran down into dim
hazes far below. All about them were small woods of resinous trees, fir and
cedar and cypress, and other kinds unknown in the Shire, with wide glades
among them; and everywhere there was a wealth of sweet-smelling herbs and
shrubs. The long journey from Rivendell had brought them far south of their
own land, but not until now in this more sheltered region had the hobbits
felt the change of clime. Here Spring was already busy about them: fronds
pierced moss and mould, larches were green-fingered, small flowers were
opening in the turf, birds were singing. Ithilien, the garden of Gondor now
desolate kept still a dishevelled dryad loveliness. South and west it looked towards the warm lower vales of Anduin,
shielded from the east by the Ephel D®ath and yet not under the
mountain-shadow, protected from the north by the Emyn Muil, open to the
southern airs and the moist winds from the Sea far away. Many great trees
grew there, planted long ago, falling into untended age amid a riot of
careless descendants; and groves and thickets there were of tamarisk and
pungent terebinth, of olive and of bay; and there were junipers and myrtles;
and thymes that grew in bushes, or with their woody creeping stems mantled
in deep tapestries the hidden stones; sages of many kinds putting forth blue
flowers, or red, or pale green; and marjorams and new-sprouting parsleys,
and many herbs of forms and scents beyond the garden-lore of Sam. The grots
and rocky walls were already starred with saxifrages and stonecrops.
Primeroles and anemones were awake in the filbert -brakes; and asphodel and
many lily -flowers nodded their half-opened heads in the grass: deep green
grass beside the pools, where falling streams halted in cool hollows on
their journey down to Anduin. The travellers turned their backs on the road and went downhill. As
they walked, brushing their way through bush and herb, sweet odours rose
about them. Gollum coughed and retched; but the hobbits breathed deep, and
suddenly Sam laughed, for heart's ease not for jest. They followed a stream
that went quickly down before them. Presently it brought them to a small
clear lake in a shallow dell: it lay in the broken ruins of an ancient stone
basin, the carven rim of which was almost wholly covered with mosses and
rose-brambles; iris-swords stood in ranks about it. and water-lily leaves
floated on its dark gently-rippling surface; but it was deep and fresh, and
spilled ever softly out over a stony lip at the far end. Here they washed themselves and drank their fill at the in-falling
freshet. Then they sought for a resting-place, and a hiding-place: for this
land, fair-seeming still, was nonetheless now territory of the Enemy. They
had not come very far from the road, and yet even in so short a space they
had seen scars of the old wars, and the newer wounds made by the Ores and
other foul servants of the Dark Lord: a pit of uncovered filth and refuse;
trees hewn down wantonly and left to die, with evil runes or the fell sign
of the Eye cut in rude strokes on their bark. Sam scrambling below the outfall of the lake, smelling and touching the
unfamiliar plants and trees, forgetful for the moment of Mordor, was
reminded suddenly of their ever-present peril. He stumbled on a ring still
scorched by fire, and in the midst of it he found a pile of charred and
broken bones and skulls. The swift growth of the wild with briar and
eglantine and trailing clematis was already drawing a veil over this place
of dreadful feast and slaughter; but it was not ancient. He hurried back to
his companions, but he said nothing: the bones were best left in peace and
not pawed and routed by Gollum. 'Let's find a place to lie up in,' he said. 'Not lower down. Higher up
for me.' A little way back above the lake they found a deep brown bed of last
year's fern. Beyond it was a thicket of dark -leaved bay-trees climbing up a
steep bank that was crowned with old cedars. Here they decided to rest and
pass the day, which already promised to be bright and warm. A good day for
strolling on their way along the groves and glades of Ithilien; but though
Ores may shun the sunlight, there were too many places here where they could
lie hid and watch; and other evil eyes were abroad: Sauron had many
servants. Gollum, in any case, would not move under the Yellow. Face. Soon
it would look over the dark ridges of the Ephel D®ath, and he would faint
and cower in the light and heat. Sam had been giving earnest thought to food as they marched. Now that
the despair of the impassable Gate was behind him, he did not feel so
inclined as his master to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the
end of their errand; and anyway it seemed wiser to him to save the waybread
of the Elves for worse times ahead. Six days or more had passed since he
reckoned that they had only a bare supply for three weeks. 'If we reach the Fire in that time, we'll be lucky at this rate ! ' he
thought. 'And we might be wanting to get back. We might! ' Besides, at the end of a long night-march, and after bathing and
drinking, he felt even more hungry than usual. A supper, or a breakfast, by
the fire in the old kitchen at Bagshot Row was what he really wanted. An
idea struck him and he turned to Gollum. Gollum had just begun to sneak off
on his own, and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern. 'Hi! Gollum! ' said Sam. 'Where are you going? Hunting? Well see here,
old noser, you don't like our food, and I'd not be sorry for a change
myself. Your new motto's always ready to help. Could you find anything fit
for a hungry hobbit? ' 'Yes, perhaps, yes,’ said Gollum. 'Smjagol always helps, if they asks
— if they asks nicely.' 'Right!' said Sam 'I does ask. And if that isn't nice enough, I begs.' Gollum disappeared. He was away some time, and Frodo after a few
mouthfuls of lembas settled deep into the brown fern and went to sleep. Sam
looked at him. The early daylight was only just creeping down into the
shadows under the trees, but he saw his master's face very clearly, and his
hands, too, lying at rest on the ground beside him. He was reminded suddenly
of Frodo as he had lain, asleep in the house of Elrond, after his deadly
wound. Then as he had kept watch Sam had noticed that at times a light
seemed to be shining faintly within; but now the light was even clearer and
stronger. Frodo's face was peaceful, the marks of fear and care had left it;
but it looked old, old and beautiful, as if the chiselling of the shaping
years was now revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden,
though the identity of the face was not changed. Not that Sam Gamgee put it
that way to himself. He shook his head, as if finding words useless, and
murmured: 'I love him. He's like that, and sometimes it shines through,
somehow. But I love him, whether or no.' Gollum returned quietly and peered over Sam's shoulder. Looking at
Frodo, he shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound. Sam came to him
moment later and found him chewing something and muttering to himself.
On the ground beside him lay two small rabbits, which he was beginning to eye
greedily. ’Smjagol always helps,’ he said. 'He has brought rabbits, nice rabbits. But master has gone to sleep, and perhaps Sam wants to sleep. Doesn't want
rabbits now? Smjagol tries to help, but he can't catch things all in a
minute.' Sam, however, had no objection to rabbit at all, and said so. At least
not to cooked rabbit. All hobbits, of course, can cook, for they begin to
learn the art before their letters (which many never reach): but Sam was a
good cook, even by hobbit reckoning, and he had done a good deal of the
camp-cooking on their travels, when there was a chance. He still hopefully
carried some of his gear in his pack: a small tinder-box, two small shallow
pans, the smaller fitting into the larger; inside them a wooden spoon, a
short two-pronged fork and some skewers were stowed; and hidden at the
bottom of the pack in a flat wooden box a dwindling treasure, some salt. But
he needed a fire, and other things besides. He thought for a bit, while he
took out his knife, cleaned and whetted it, and began to dress the rabbits. He was not going to leave Frodo alone asleep even for a few minutes. 'Now, Gollum,' he said, 'I've another job for you. Go and fill these
pans with water, and bring 'em back! ' 'Smjagol will fetch water, yes,' said Gollum. 'But what does the hobbit
want all that water for? He has drunk, he has washed.' 'Never you mind,' said Sam. 'If you can't guess, you'll soon find out. And the sooner you fetch the water, the sooner you'll learn. Don't you
damage one of my pans, or I'll carve you into mincemeat.' While Gollum was away Sam took another look at Frodo. He was still
sleeping quietly, but Sam was now struck most by the leanness of his face
and hands. 'Too thin and drawn he is,' he muttered. 'Not right for a hobbit. If I can get these coneys cooked, I'm going to wake him up.' Sam gathered a pile of the driest fern, and then scrambled up the bank
collecting a bundle of twigs and broken wood; the fallen branch of a cedar
at the top gave him a good supply. He cut out some turves at the foot of the
bank just outside the fern-brake, and made a shallow hole and laid his fuel
in it. Being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going. It
made little or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent. He was just stooping
over his fire, shielding it and building it up with heavier wood, when
Gollum returned, carrying the pans carefully and grumbling to himself. He set the pans down, and then suddenly saw what Sam was doing. He gave
a thin hissing shriek, and seemed to be both frightened and angry. 'Ach! Sss
— no!' he cried. 'No! Silly hobbits, foolish, yes foolish! They mustn't do
it!’ 'Mustn't do what?' asked Sam in surprise. 'Not make the nassty red tongues,' hissed Gollum. 'Fire, fire! It's
dangerous, yes it is. It burns, it kills. And it will bring enemies, yes it
will.' 'I don't think so,' said Sam. 'Don't see why it should, if you don't
put wet stuff on it and make a smother. But if it does, it does. I'm going
to risk it, anyhow. I'm going to stew these coneys.' 'Stew the rabbits!' squealed Gollum in dismay. 'Spoil beautiful meat
Smjagol saved for you, poor hungry Smjagol! What for? What for, silly
hobbit? They are young, they are tender, they are nice. Eat them, eat them!’ He clawed at the nearest rabbit, already skinned and lying by the fire. 'Now, now! ' said Sam. 'Each to his own fashion. Our bread chokes you,
and raw coney chokes me. If you give me a coney, the coney's mine, see, to
cook, if I have a mind. And I have. You needn't watch me. Go and catch
another and eat it as you fancy — somewhere private and out o' my sight.
Then you won't see the fire, and I shan't see you, and we'll both be the
happier. I'll see the fire don't smoke, if that's any comfort to you.' Gollum withdrew grumbling, and crawled into the fern. Sam busied
himself with his pans. 'What a hobbit needs with coney,' he said to himself, 'is some herbs and roots, especially taters — not to mention bread. Herbs
we can manage, seemingly.’ 'Gollum!' he called softly. 'Third time pays for all. I want some
herbs.’ Gollum's head peeped out of the fern, but his looks were neither
helpful nor friendly. 'A few bay-leaves, some thyme and sage, will do —
before the water boils,' said Sam. 'No! ' said Gollum. 'Smjagol is not pleased. And Smjagol doesn't like
smelly leaves. He doesn't eat grasses or roots, no precious, not till he's
starving or very sick, poor Smjagol. '
'Smjagol'll get into real true hot water, when this water boils, if he
don’t do as he’s asked,’ growled Sam. 'Sam'llput his head in it, yes
precious. And I’d make him look for turnips and carrots, and taters too, if
it was the time o’ the year. I’ll bet there’s all sorts of good things
running wild in this country. I’d give a lot for half a dozen taters.’ 'Smjagol won’t go, O no precious, not this time,’ hissed Gollum. 'He’s
frightened, and he’s very tired, and this hobbit's not nice, not nice at
all. Smjagol won't grub for roots and carrotses and — taters. What's
taters, precious, eh, what's taters? 'Po-ta-toes,' said Sam. 'The Gaffer’s delight, and rare good ballast
for an empty belly. But you won't find any, so you needn't look. But be good
Smjagol and fetch me the herbs, and I'll think better of you. What's more,
if you turn over a new leaf, and keep it turned, I'll cook you some taters
one of these days. I will: fried fish and chips served by S. Gamgee. You
couldn't say no to that.' 'Yes, yes we could. Spoiling nice fish, scorching it. Give me fish now,
and keep nassty chips ! ' 'Oh you're hopeless,' said Sam. 'Go to sleep!' In the end he had to find what he wanted for himself; but he did not
have to go far, not out of sight of the place where his master lay, still
sleeping. For a while Sam sat musing, and tending the fire till the water
boiled. The daylight grew and the air became warm; the dew faded off turf
and leaf. Soon the rabbits cut up lay simmering in their pans with the
bunched herbs. Almost Sam fell asleep as the time went by. He let them stew
for close on an hour, testing them now and again with his fork, and tasting
the broth. When he thought all was ready he lifted the pans off the fire, and
crept along to Frodo. Frodo half opened his eyes as Sam stood over him, and
then he wakened from his dreaming: another gentle, unrecoverable dream of
peace. 'Hullo, Sam! ’ he said. 'Not resting? Is anything wrong? What is the
time? ’ 'About a couple of hours after daybreak,’ said Sam, 'and nigh on half
past eight by Shire clocks, maybe. But nothing's wrong. Though it ain't
quite what I'd call right: no stock, no onions, no taters. I've got a bit of
a stew for you, and some broth, Mr. Frodo. Do you good. You'll have to sup
it in your mug; or straight from the pan, when it's cooled a bit. I haven't
brought no bowls, nor nothing proper.' Frodo yawned and stretched. 'You should have been resting Sam,' he
said. 'And lighting a fire was dangerous in these parts. But I do feel
hungry. Hmm! Can I smell it from here? What have you stewed? ' 'A present from Smjagol,' said Sam: 'a brace o' young coneys; though I
fancy Gollum's regretting them now. But there's nought to go with them but a
few herbs.' Sam and his master sat just within the fern-brake and ate their stew
from the pans, sharing the old fork and spoon. They allowed themselves half
a piece of the Elvish waybread each. It seemed a feast. 'Wheew! Gollum! ' Sam called and whistled softly. 'Come on! Still time
to change your mind. There's some left, if you want to try stewed coney.'
There was no answer. 'Oh well, I suppose he's gone off to find something for himself. We'll
finish it,' said Sam. 'And then you must take some sleep,' said Frodo. 'Don't you drop off, while I'm nodding, Mr. Frodo. I don't feel too
sure of him. There's a good deal of Stinker -the bad Gollum, if you
understand me-in him still, and it's getting stronger again. Not but what I
think he'd try to throttle me first now. We don't see eye to eye, and he's
not pleased with Sam, O no precious, not pleased at all.' They finished, and Sam went off to the stream to rinse his gear. As he
stood up to return, he looked back up the slope. At that moment he saw the
sun rise out of the reek, or haze, or dark shadow, or whatever it was, that
lay ever to the east, and it sent its golden beams down upon the trees and
glades about him. Then he noticed a thin spiral of blue-grey, smoke, plain
to see as it caught the sunlight, rising from a thicket above him. With a
shock he realized that this was the smoke from his little cooking-fire,
which he had neglected to put out. 'That won't do! Never thought it would show like that! ' he muttered,
and he started to hurry back. Suddenly he halted and listened. Flad he heard
a whistle or not? Or was it the call of some strange bird? If it was a
whistle, it did not come from Frodo's direction. There it went again from
another place! Sam began to run as well as he could uphill. He found that a small brand, burning away to its outer end, had kindled
some fern at the edge of the fire, and the fern blazing up had set the
turves smouldering. Hastily he stamped out what was left of the fire,
scattered the ashes, and laid the turves on the hole. Then he crept back to
Frodo. 'Did you hear a whistle, and what sounded like an answer? ' he asked. 'A few minutes back. I hope it was only a bird, but it didn’t sound quite
like that: more like somebody mimicking a bird-call, I thought. And I'm
afraid my bit of fire's been smoking. Now if I've gone and brought trouble, I'll never forgive myself. Nor won't have a chance, maybe! ' 'Hush! ' whispered Frodo. 'I thought I heard voices.’ The two hobbits trussed their small packs, put them on ready for
flight, and then crawled deeper into the fern. There they crouched
listening. There was no doubt of the voices. They were speaking low and furtively,
but they were near, and coming nearer. Then quite suddenly one spoke clearly
close at hand. 'Here! Here is where the smoke came from! ' it said. 'Twill be nigh at
hand. In the fern, no doubt. We shall have it like a coney in a trap. Then
we shall learn what kind of thing it is.' 'Aye, and what it knows! ' said a second voice. At once four men came striding through the fern from different
directions. Since flight and hiding were no longer possible, Frodo and Sam
sprang to their feet, putting back to back and whipping out their small
swords. If they were astonished at what they saw, their captors were even more
astonished. Four tall Men stood there. Two had spears in their hands with
broad bright heads. Two had great bows, almost of their own height, and
great quivers of long green -feathered arrows. All had swords at their sides,
and were clad in green and brown of varied hues, as if the better to walk
unseen in the glades of Ithilien. Green gauntlets covered their hands, and
their faces were hooded and masked with green, except for their eyes, which
were very keen and bright. At once Frodo thought of Boromir, for these Men
were like him in stature and bearing, and in their manner of speech. 'We have not found what we sought,’ said one. 'But what have we found? f 'Not Ores,' said another, releasing the hilt of his sword, which he had
seized when he saw the glitter of Sting in Frodo's hand. 'Elves? ’ said a third, doubtfully. 'Nay! Not Elves,' said the fourth, the tallest, and as it appeared the
chief among them. 'Elves do not walk in Ithilien in these days. And Elves
are wondrous fair to look upon, or so ’tis said.' ’Meaning we're not, I take you,' said Sam. 'Thank you kindly. And when
you've finished discussing us, perhaps you'll say who you are, and why you
can't let two tired travellers rest.' The tall green man laughed grimly. 'I am Faramir, Captain of Gondor,'
he said. 'But there are no travellers in this land: only the servants of the
Dark Tower, or of the White.' 'But we are neither,’ said Frodo. 'And travellers we are, whatever
Captain Faramir may say.' 'Then make haste to declare yourselves and your errand,' said Faramir. 'We have a work to do, and this is no time or place for riddling or
parleying. Come! Where is the third of your company? ' 'The third? ’ 'Yes, the skulking fellow that we saw with his nose in the pool down
yonder. He had an ill-favoured look. Some spying breed of Ore, I guess, or a
creature of theirs. But he gave us the slip by some fox-trick.' 'I do not know where he is,' said Frodo. 'He is only a chance companion
met upon our road; and I am not answerable for him. If you come on him,
spare him. Bring him or send him to us. He is only a wretched gangrel
creature, but I have him under my care for a while. But as for us, we are
Hobbits of the Shire, far to the North and West, beyond many rivers. Frodo
son of Drogo is my name, and with me is Samwise son of Hamfast, a worthy
hobbit in my service. We have come by long ways — out of Rivendell, or
Imladris as some call it.' Here Faramir started and grew intent. 'Seven
companions we had: one we lost at Moria, the others we left at Parth Galen
above Rauros: two of my kin; a Dwarf there was also, and an Elf, and two
Men. They were Aragorn; and Boromir, who said that he came out of Minas
Tirith, a city in the South.' 'Boromir! ' all the four men exclaimed. 'Boromir son of the Ford Denethor?' said Faramir, and a strange stern
look came into his face. 'You came with him? That is news indeed, if it be
true. Know, little strangers, that Boromir son of Denethor was High Warden
of the White Tower, and our Captain-General: sorely do we miss him. Who are
you then, and what had you to do with him? Be swift, for the Sun is
climbing!' 'Are the riddling words known to you that Boromir brought to Rivendell?
’ Frodo replied. Seek for the Sword that was Broken. In Imladris it dwells. 'The words are known indeed,' said Faramir in astonishment. v It is some
token of your truth that you also know them.' 'Aragorn whom I named is the bearer of the Sword that was Broken,' said
Frodo. 'And we are the Halflings that the rhyme spoke of.' 'That I see,' said Faramir thoughtfully. 'Or I see that it might be so. And what is Isildur's Bane? ' 'That is hidden,' answered Frodo. 'Doubtless it will be made clear in
time.’ 'We must learn more of this,’ said Faramir, 'and know what brings you
so far east under the shadow of yonder—,' he pointed and said no name. 'But
not now. We have business in hand. You are in peril, and you would not have
gone far by field or road this day. There will be hard handstrokes nigh at
hand ere the day is full. Then death, or swift flight bark to Anduin. I will
leave two to guard you, for your good and for mine. Wise man trusts not to
chance-meeting on the road in this land. If I return, I will speak more with
you.' 'Farewell!' said Frodo, bowing low. 'Think what you will, I am a friend
of all enemies of the One Enemy. We would go with you, if we halfling folk
could hope to serve you, such doughty men and strong as you seem, and if my
errand permitted it. May the light shine on your swords!' 'The Halflings are courteous folk, whatever else they be,' said
Faramir. 'Farewell!' The hobbits sat down again, but they said nothing to one another of
their thoughts and doubts. Close by, just under the dappling shadow of the
dark bay-trees, two men remained on guard. They took off their masks now and
again to cool them, as the day-heat grew, and Frodo saw that they were
goodly men, pale-skinned, dark of hair, with grey eyes and faces sad and
proud. They spoke together in soft voices, at first using the Common Speech,
but after the manner of older days, and then changing to another language of
their own. To his amazement, as he listened Frodo became aware that it was
the Elven-tongue that they spoke, or one but little different; and he looked
at them with wonder, for he knew then that they must be D®nedain of the
South, men of the line of the Lords of Westernesse. After a while he spoke to them; but they were slow and cautious in
answering. They named themselves Mablung and Damrod, soldiers of Gondor,
and they were Rangers of Ithilien; for they were descended from folk who lived
in Ithilien at one time, before it was overrun. From such men the Lord
Denethor chose his forayers, who crossed the Anduin secretly (how or where,
they would not say) to harry the Ores and other enemies that roamed between
the Ephel D®ath and the River. 'It is close on ten leagues hence to the east-shore of Anduin,' said
Mablung, ’and we seldom come so far afield. But we have a new errand on this
journey: we come to ambush the Men of Harad. Curse them! ' 'Aye, curse the Southrons! ' said Damrod. ' 'Tis said that there were
dealings of old between Gondor and the kingdoms of the Harad in the Far
South; though there was never friendship. In those days our bounds were away
south beyond the mouths of Anduin, and Umbar, the nearest of their realms,
acknowledged our sway. But that is long since. 'Tis many lives of Men since
any passed to or fro between us. Now of late we have learned that the Enemy
has been among them, and they are gone over to Him, or back to Him-they
were ever ready to His will -as have so many also in the East. I doubt not that
the days of Gondor are numbered, and the walls of Minas Tirith are doomed,
so great is His strength and malice.' 'But still we will not sit idle and let Him do all as He would,' said
Mablung. 'These cursed Southrons come now marching up the ancient roads
to swell the hosts of the Dark Tower. Yea, up the very roads that craft of
Gondor made. And they go ever more heedlessly, we learn, thinking that the
power of their new master is great enough, so that the mere shadow of His
hills will protect them. We come to teach them another lesson. Great
strength of them was reported to us some days ago, marching north. One of
their regiments is due by our reckoning to pass by, some time ere noon-up on
the road above, where it passes through the cloven way. The road may pass,
but they shall not! Not while Faramir is Captain. He leads now in all
perilous ventures. But his life is charmed, or fate spares him for some
other end.' Their talk died down into a listening silence. All seemed still and
watchful. Sam, crouched by the edge of the fern-brake, peered out. With his
keen hobbit-eyes he saw that many more Men were about. He could see
them stealing up the slopes, singly or in long files, keeping always to the shade
of grove or thicket, or crawling, hardly visible in their brown and green
raiment, through grass and brake. All were hooded and masked, and had
gauntlets on their hands, and were armed like Faramir and his companions.
Before long they had all passed and vanished. The sun rose till it neared
the South. The shadows shrank. 'I wonder where that dratted Gollum is? ' thought Sam, as he crawled
back into deeper shade. 'He stands a fair chance of being spitted for an
Ore, or of being roasted by the Yellow Face. But I fancy he’ll look after
himself.' He lay down beside Frodo and began to doze. He woke, thinking that he had heard horns blowing. He sat up. It was
now high noon. The guards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees.
Suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from above, over the
top of the slope. Sam thought that he heard cries and wild shouting also,
but the sound was faint, as if it came out of some distant cave. Then
presently the noise of fighting broke out near at hand, just above their
hiding-place. He could hear plainly the ringing grate of steel on steel, the
clang of sword on iron cap, the dull beat of blade on shield; men were
yelling and screaming, and one clear loud voice was calling Gondorl Gondorl 'It sounds like a hundred blacksmiths all smithying together,’ said Sam
to Frodo. ’They’re as near as I want them now.’ But the noise grew closer. 'They are coming!’ cried Damrod. 'See! Some
of the Southrons have broken from the trap and are flying from the road.
There they go! Our men after them, and the Captain leading.’ Sam, eager to see more, went now and joined the guards. He scrambled a
little way up into one of the larger of the bay-trees. For a moment he
caught a glimpse of swarthy men in red running down the slope some way off
with green-clad warriors leaping after them, hewing them down as they fled.
Arrows were thick in the air. Then suddenly straight over the rim of their
sheltering bank, a man fell, crashing through the slender trees, nearly on
top of them. He came to rest in the fern a few feet away, face downward,
green arrow-feathers sticking from his neck below a golden collar. His
scarlet robes were tattered, his corslet of overlapping brazen plates was
rent and hewn, his black plaits of hair braided with gold were drenched with
blood. His brown hand still clutched the hilt of a broken sword.
It was Sam's first view of a battle of Men against Men, and he did not
like it much. He was glad that he could not see the dead face. He wondered
what the man's name was and where he came from; and if he was really evil of
heart, or what lies or threats had led him on the long march from his home;
and if he would not really rather have stayed there in peace -all in a flash
of thought which was quickly driven from his mind. For just as Mablung
stepped towards the fallen body, there was a new noise. Great crying and
shouting. Amidst it Sam heard a shrill bellowing or trumpeting. And then a
great thudding and bumping, like huge rams dinning on the ground. 'Ware! Ware!' cried Damrod to his companion. 'May the Valar turn him
aside! Mymak! Mymak!' To his astonishment and terror, and lasting delight, Sam saw a vast
shape crash out of the trees and come careering down the slope. Big as a
house, much bigger than a house, it looked to him, a grey-clad moving hill.
Fear and wonder, maybe, enlarged him in the hobbit's eyes, but the Mymak of
Harad was indeed a beast of vast bulk, and the like of him does not walk now
in Middle-earth; his kin that live still in latter days are but memories of
his girth and majesty. On he came, straight towards the watchers, and then
swerved aside in the nick of time, passing only a few yards away, rocking
the ground beneath their feet: his great legs like trees, enormous sail-like
ears spread out, long snout upraised like a huge serpent about to strike,
his small red eyes raging. His upturned hornlike tusks were bound with bands
of gold and dripped with blood. His trappings of scarlet and gold flapped
about him in wild tatters. The ruins of what seemed a very war-tower lay
upon his heaving back, smashed in his furious passage through the woods; and
high upon his neck still desperately clung a tiny figure-the body of a
mighty warrior, a giant among the Swertings. On the great beast thundered, blundering in blind wrath through pool
and thicket. Arrows skipped and snapped harmlessly about the triple hide of
his flanks. Men of both sides fled before him, but many he overtook and
crushed to the ground. Soon he was lost to view, still trumpeting and
stamping far away. What became of him Sam never heard: whether he escaped
to roam the wild for a time, until he perished far from his home or was trapped
in some deep pit; or whether he raged on until he plunged in the Great River
and was swallowed up. Sam drew a deep breath. 'An Oliphaunt it was!' he said. 'So there are
Oliphaunts, and I have seen one. What a life! But no one at home will ever
believe me. Well, if that's over, I'll have a bit of sleep.' 'Sleep while you may,' said Mablung. 'But the Captain will return, if
he is unhurt; and when he comes we shall depart swiftly. We shall be pursued
as soon as news of our deed reaches the Enemy, and that will not be long.' 'Go quietly when you must!’ said Sam. 'No need to disturb my sleep. I
was walking all night.' Mablung laughed. 'I do not think the Captain will leave you here,
Master Samwise,’ he said. 'But you shall see.'
Chapter 5 . The Window on the West It seemed to Sam that he had only dozed for a few minutes when he awoke
to find that it was late afternoon and Faramir had come back. He had brought
many men with him; indeed all the survivors of the foray were now gathered
on the slope nearby, two or three hundred strong. They sat in a wide
semicircle, between the arms of which Faramir was seated on the ground,
while Frodo stood before him. It looked strangely like the trial of a
prisoner. Sam crept out from the fern, but no one paid any attention to him, and
he placed himself at the end of the rows of men, where he could see and hear
all that was going on. He watched and listened intently, ready to dash to
his master's aid if needed. He could see Faramir's face, which was now
unmasked: it was stern and commanding, and a keen wit lay behind his
searching glance. Doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at Frodo. Sam soon became aware that the Captain was not satisfied with Frodo's
account of himself at several points: what part he had to play in the
Company that set out from Rivendell; why he had left Boromir; and where he
was now going. In particular he returned often to Isildur's Bane. Plainly he
saw that Frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance. 'But it was at the coming of the Halfling that Isildur's Bane should
waken, or so one must read the words,' he insisted. 'If then you are the
Halfling that was named, doubtless you brought this thing, whatever it may
be, to the Council of which you speak, and there Boromir saw it. Do you deny
it? ' Frodo made no answer. 'So! ' said Faramir. V I wish then to learn from
you more of it; for what concerns Boromir concerns me. An ore-arrow slew
Isildur, so far as old tales tell. But ore-arrows are plenty, and the sight
of one would not be taken as a sign of Doom by Boromir of Gondor. Had you
this thing in keeping? It is hidden, you say; but is not that because you
choose to hide it? ' 'No, not because I choose,' answered Frodo. v It does not belong to me. It does not belong to any mortal, great or small; though if any could claim
it, it would be Aragorn son of Arathorn, whom I named, the leader of our
Company from Moria to Rauros.'
'Why so, and not Boromir, prince of the City that the sons of Elendil
founded? ' 'Because Aragorn is descended in direct lineage, father to father, from
Isildur Elendil's son himself. And the sword that he bears was Elendil's
sword.' A murmur of astonishment ran through all the ring of men. Some cried
aloud: 'The sword of Elendil! The sword of Elendil comes to Minas Tirith!
Great tidings! ' But Faramir's face was unmoved. 'Maybe,' he said. 'But so great a claim will need to be established and
clear proofs will be required, should this Aragorn ever come to Minas
Tirith. He had not come, nor any of your Company, when I set out six days
ago.' 'Boromir was satisfied of that claim,' said Frodo. 'Indeed, if Boromir
were here, he would answer all your questions. And since he was already at
Rauros many days back, and intended then to go straight to your city, if you
return, you may soon learn the answers there. My part in the Company was
known to him, as to all the others, for it was appointed to me by Elrond of
Imladris himself before the whole Council. On that errand I came into this
country, but it is not mine to reveal to any outside the Company. Yet those
who claim to oppose the Enemy would do well not to hinder it.' Frodo's tone was proud, whatever he felt, and Sam approved of it; but
it did not appease Faramir. 'So!' he said. 'You bid me mind my own affairs, and get me back home,
and let you be. Boromir will tell all, when he comes. When he comes, say
you! Were you a friend of Boromir?’ Vividly before Frodo's mind came the memory of Boromir's assault upon
him, and for a moment he hesitated. Faramir's eyes watching him grew harder.
'Boromir was a valiant member of our Company ' said Frodo at length. 'Yes, I
was his friend, for my part.' Faramir smiled grimly. 'Then you would grieve to learn that Boromir is
dead? ' 'I would grieve indeed,' said Frodo. Then catching the look in
Faramir's eyes, he faltered. 'Dead?' he said. 'Do you mean that he is dead,
and that you knew it? You have been trying to trap me in words, playing with
me? Or are you now trying to snare me with a falsehood?' 'I would not snare even an ore with a falsehood,' said Faramir. 'How then did he die, and how do you know of it? Since you say that
none of the Company had reached the city when you left.' 'As to the manner of his death, I had hoped that his friend and
companion would tell me how it was.' 'But he was alive and strong when we parted. And he lives still for all
that I know. Though surely there are many perils in the world.' 'Many indeed,' said Faramir, 'and treachery not the least.’ Sam had been getting more and more impatient and angry at this
conversation. These last words were more than he could bear, and bursting
into the middle of the ring, he strode up to his master's side. 'Begging your pardon, Mr. Frodo,' he said, 'but this has gone on long
enough. Tie's no right to talk to you so. After all you've gone through, as
much for his good and all these great Men as for anyone else. 'See here, Captain! ' He planted himself squarely in front of Faramir
his hands on his hips, and a look on his face as if he was addressing a
young hobbit who had offered him what he called 'sauce' when questioned
about visits to the orchard. There was some murmuring, but also some grins
on the faces of the men looking on: the sight of their Captain sitting on
the ground and eye to eye with a young hobbit, legs well apart, bristling
with wrath, was one beyond their experience. 'See here! ’ he said. 'What are
you driving at? Let's come to the point before all the Ores of Mordor come
down on us! If you think my master murdered this Boromir and then ran away,
you've got no sense; but say it, and have done! And then let us know what
you mean to do about it. But it's a pity that folk as talk about fighting
the Enemy can't let others do their bit in their own way without
interfering. He'd be mighty pleased, if he could see you now. Think he'd got
a new friend, he would.' 'Patience!' said Faramir, but without anger. 'Do not speak before your
master, whose wit is greater than yours. And I do not need any to teach me
of our peril. Even so, I spare a brief time, in order to judge justly in a
hard matter. Were I as hasty as you, I might have slain you long ago. For I
am commanded to slay all whom I find in this land without the leave of the
Lord of Gondor. But I do not slay man or beast needlessly, and not gladly
even when it is needed. Neither do I talk in vain. So be comforted. Sit by
your master, and be silent! ’ Sam sat down heavily with a red face. Faramir turned to Frodo again: 'You asked how do I know that the son of Denethor is dead. Tidings of death
have many wings. Night oft brings news to near kindred, 'tis said. Boromir
was my brother.' A shadow of sorrow passed over his face. 'Do you remember aught of
special mark that the Lord Boromir bore with him among his gear?' Frodo thought for a moment, fearing some further trap, and wondering
how this debate would turn in the end. He had hardly saved the Ring from the
proud grasp of Boromir, and how he would fare now among so many men,
warlike and strong, he did not know. Yet he felt in his heart that Faramir, though
he was much like his brother in looks, was a man less self-regarding, both
sterner and wiser. 'I remember that Boromir bore a horn,' he said at last. 'You remember well, and as one who has in truth seen him,' said
Faramir. 'Then maybe you can see it in your mind's eye: a great horn of the
wild ox of the East, bound with silver, and written with ancient characters. That horn the eldest son of our house has borne for many generations; and it
is said that if it be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of Gondor, as
the realm was of old, its voice will not pass unheeded. 'Five days ere I set out on this venture, eleven days ago at about this
hour of the day, I heard the blowing of that horn: from the northward it
seemed, but dim, as if it were but an echo in the mind. A boding of ill we
thought it, my father and I, for no tidings had we heard of Boromir since he
went away, and no watcher on our borders had seen him pass. And on the third
night after another and a stranger thing befell me. 'I sat at night by the waters of Anduin, in the grey dark under the
young pale moon, watching the ever -moving stream; and the sad reeds were
rustling. So do we ever watch the shores nigh Osgiliath, which our enemies
now partly hold, and issue from it to harry our lands. But that night all
the world slept at the midnight hour. Then I saw, or it seemed that I saw, a
boat floating on the water, glimmering grey, a small boat of a strange
fashion with a high prow, and there was none to row or steer it. 'An awe fell on me, for a pale light was round it. But I rose and went
to the bank, and began to walk out into the stream, for I was drawn towards
it. Then the boat turned towards me, and stayed its pace, and floated slowly
by within my hand's reach, yet I durst not handle it. It waded deep, as if
it were heavily burdened, and it seemed to me as it passed under my gaze
that it was almost filled with clear water, from which came the light; and
lapped in the water a warrior lay asleep. 'A broken sword was on his knee. I saw many wounds on him. It was
Boromir, my brother, dead. I knew his gear, his sword, his beloved face. One
thing only I missed: his horn. One thing only I knew not: a fair belt, as it
were of linked golden leaves, about his waist. Boromir! I cried. Where is
thy horn? Whither goest thou? O Boromir! But he was gone. The boat turned
into the stream and passed glimmering on into the night. Dreamlike it was.
and yet no dream, for there was no waking. And I do not doubt that he is
dead and has passed down the River to the Sea.' 'Alas!' said Frodo. That was indeed Boromir as I knew him. For the
golden belt was given to him in Lothlurien by the Lady Galadriel. She it was
that clothed us as you see us, in elven-grey. This brooch is of the same
workmanship.' Fie touched the green and silver leaf that fastened his cloak
beneath his throat. Faramir looked closely at it. Tt is beautiful,' he said. 'Yes, 'tis
work of the same craft. So then you passed through the Land of Lurien?
Laurelindurenan it was named of old, but long now it has lain beyond the
knowledge of Men,' he added softly, regarding Frodo with a new wonder in his
eyes. 'Much that was strange about you I begin now to understand. Will you
not tell me more? For it is a bitter thought that Boromir died, within sight
of the land of his home.' 'No more can I say than I have said,' answered Frodo. 'Though your tale
fills me with foreboding. A vision it was that you saw, I think, and no
more, some shadow of evil fortune that has been or will be. Unless indeed it
is some lying trick of the Enemy. I have seen the faces of fair warriors of
old laid in sleep beneath the pools of the Dead Marshes, or seeming so by
his foul arts.’ 'Nay, it was not so,' said Faramir. 'For his works fill the heart with
loathing; but my heart was filled with grief and pity.' 'Yet how could such a thing have happened in truth? ' asked Frodo. 'For
no boat could have been carried over the stony hills from Tol Brandir; and
Boromir purposed to go home across the Entwash and the fields of Rohan. And yet how could any vessel ride the foam of the great falls and not founder in
the boiling pools, though laden with water? ' 'I know not,' said Faramir. 'But whence came the boat? ' 'From Lurien,' said Frodo. 'In three such boats we rowed down Anduin to
the Falls. They also were of elven-work.' 'You passed through the Hidden Land,' said Faramir, 'but it seems that
you little understood its power. If Men have dealings with the Mistress of
Magic who dwells in the Golden Wood, then they may look for strange things
to follow. For it is perilous for mortal man to walk out of the world of
this Sun, and few of old came thence unchanged, 'tis said. ' Boromir , O Boromir!' he cried. "What did she say to you, the Lady that
dies not? What did she see? What woke in your heart then? Why went you ever
to Laurelindurenan, and came not by your own road, upon the horses of
Rohan riding home in the morning?' Then turning again to Frodo, he spoke in a quiet voice once more. To
those questions I guess that you could make some answer, Frodo son of Drogo.
But not here or now. maybe. But lest you still should think my tale a
vision, I will tell you this. The horn of Boromir at least returned in
truth, and not in seeming. The horn came, but it was cloven in two, as it
were by axe or sword. The shards came severally to shore: one was found
among the reeds where watchers of Gondor lay, northwards below the infalls
of the Entwash; the other was found spinning on the flood by one who had an
errand in the water. Strange chances, but murder will out, 'tis said. 'And now the horn of the elder son lies in two pieces upon the lap of
Denethor, sitting in his high chair, waiting for news. And you can tell me
nothing of the cleaving of the horn? ' 'No, I did not know of it,' said Frodo. 'But the day when you heard it
blowing, if your reckoning is true, was the day when we parted, when I and
my servant left the Company. And now your tale fills me with dread. For if
Boromir was then in peril and was slain, I must fear that all my companions
perished too. And they were my kindred and my friends. 'Will you not put aside your doubt of me and let me go? I am weary, and
full of grief, and afraid. But I have a deed to do, or to attempt, before I
too am slain. And the more need of haste, if we two halflings are all that
remain of our fellowship. 'Go back, Faramir, valiant Captain of Gondor, and defend your city
while you may, and let me go where my doom takes me.' 'For me there is no comfort in our speech together,' said Faramir; 'but
you surely draw from it more dread than need be. Unless the people of Lurien
themselves came to him, who arrayed Boromir as for a funeral? Not Ores or
servants of the Nameless. Some of your Company, I guess, live still. 'But whatever befell on the North March, you, Frodo, I doubt no longer.
If hard days have made me any judge of Men’s words and faces, then I may
make a guess at Halflings! Though,’ and now he smiled, There is something
strange about you, Frodo, an elvish air, maybe. But more lies upon our words
together than I thought at first. I should now take you back to Minas Tirith
to answer there to Denethor, and my life will justly be forfeit, if I now
choose a course that proves ill for my city. So I will not decide in haste
what is to be done. Yet we must move hence without more delay.' He sprang to his feet and issued some orders. At once the men who were
gathered round him broke up into small groups, and went off this way and
that, vanishing quickly into the shadows of the rocks and trees. Soon only
Mablung and Damrod remained. 'Now you, Frodo and Samwise, will come with me and my guards,' said
Faramir. v You cannot go along the road southwards, if that was your purpose.
It will be unsafe for some days, and always more closely watched after this
affray than it has been yet. And you cannot, I think, go far today in any
case, for you are weary. And so are we. We are going now to a secret place
we have, somewhat less than ten miles from here. The Ores and spies of the
Enemy have not found it yet, and if they did, we could hold it long even
against many. There we may lie up and rest for a while, and you with us. In
the morning I will decide what is best for me to do, and for you.' There was nothing for Frodo to do but to fall in with this request, or
order. It seemed in any case a wise course for the moment, since this foray
of the men of Gondor had made a journey in Ithilien more dangerous than
ever. They set out at once: Mablung and Damrod a little ahead, and Faramir
with Frodo and Sam behind. Skirting the hither side of the pool where the
hobbits had bathed, they crossed the stream, climbed a long bank, and passed
into green-shadowed woodlands that marched ever downwards and
westwards. While they walked, as swiftly as the hobbits could go, they talked in hushed
voices. 'I broke off our speech together,' said Faramir, 'not only because time
pressed, as Master Samwise had reminded me, but also because we were
drawing near to matters that were better not debated openly before many men. It was
for that reason that I turned rather to the matter of my brother and let be
Isildur's Bane. You were not wholly frank with me, Frodo.'
'I told no lies, and of the truth all I could,' said Frodo. 'I do not blame you,' said Faramir. 'You spoke with skill in a hard
place, and wisely, it seemed to me. But I learned or guessed more from you
than your words said. You were not friendly with Boromir, or you did not
part in friendship. You, and Master Samwise, too, I guess have some
grievance. Now I loved him dearly, and would gladly avenge his death, yet I
knew him well. Isildur's Bane — I would hazard that Isildur's Bane lay
between you and was a cause of contention in your Company. Clearly it is a
mighty heirloom of some sort, and such things do not breed peace among
confederates, not if aught may be learned from ancient tales. Do I not hit
near the mark?' 'Near,' said Frodo, 'but not in the gold. There was no contention in
our Company, though there was doubt: doubt which way we should take from
the Emyn Muil. But be that as it may, ancient tales teach us also the peril of
rash words concerning such things as — heirlooms.' 'Ah, then it is as I thought: your trouble was with Boromir alone. Fie
wished this thing brought to Minas Tirith. Alas! it is a crooked fate that
seals your lips who saw him last, and holds from me that which I long to
know: what was in his heart and thought in his latest hours. Whether he
erred or no, of this I am sure: he died well, achieving some good thing. His
face was more beautiful even than in life. 'But, Frodo, I pressed you hard at first about Isildur's Bane. Forgive
me! It was unwise in such an hour and place. I had not had time for thought.
We had had a hard fight, and there was more than enough to fill my mind. But
even as I spoke with you, I drew nearer to the mark, and so deliberately
shot wider. For you must know that much is still preserved of ancient lore
among the Rulers of the city that is not spread abroad. We of my house are
not of the line of Elendil. though the blood of N®menor is in us. For we
reckon back our line to Mardil, the good steward, who ruled in the king's
stead when he went away to war. And that was King Edrnur, last of the line
of Anbrion, and childless, and he came never back. And the stewards have
governed the city since that day, though it was many generations of Men ago. 'And this I remember of Boromir as a boy, when we together learned the
tale of our sires and the history of our city, that always it displeased him
that his father was not king. "How many hundreds of years needs it to make a
steward a king, if the king returns not? " he asked. "Few years, maybe, in
other places of less royalty," my father answered. "In Gondor ten thousand
years would not suffice." Alas! poor Boromir. Does that not tell you
something of him? ' 'It does,' said Frodo. 'Yet always he treated Aragorn with honour.' 'I doubt it not,' said Faramir. 'If he were satisfied of Aragorn's
claim as you say, he would greatly reverence him. But the pinch has not yet
come. They had not yet reached Minas Tirith or become rivals in her wars. 'But I stray. We in the house of Denethor know much ancient lore by
long tradition, and there are moreover in our treasuries many things
preserved: books and tablets writ on withered parchments, yea, and on stone,
and on leaves of silver and of gold, in divers characters. Some none can now
read; and for the rest, few ever unlock them. I can read a little in them,
for I have had teaching. It was these records that brought the Grey Pilgrim
to us. I first saw him when I was a child, and he has been twice or thrice
since then.’ 'The Grey Pilgrim? ' said Frodo. 'Had he a name?' 'Mithrandir we called him in elf-fashion,' said Faramir, 'and he was
content. Many are my names in many countries , he said. Mithrandir among the
Elves, Tharkyn to the Dwarves; Olurin I was in my youth in the West that is
forgotten, in the South Incbnus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I go
not.' 'Gandalf!' said Frodo. 'I thought it was he. Gandalf the Grey dearest
of counsellors. Leader of our Company. He was lost in Moria.' 'Mithrandir was lost! ' said Faramir. 'An evil fate seems to have
pursued your fellowship. It is hard indeed to believe that one of so great
wisdom, and of power — for many wonderful things he did among us — could
perish, and so much lore be taken from the world. Are you sure of this, and
that he did not just leave you and depart where he would? ' 'Alas! yes,' said Frodo. 'I saw him fall into the abyss.' 'I see that there is some great tale of dread in this.' said Faramir
'which perhaps you may tell me in the evening -time. This Mithrandir was, I
now guess, more than a lore-master: a great mover of the deeds that are done
in our time. Had he been among us to consult concerning the hard words of
our dream, he could have made them clear to us without need of messenger.
Yet, maybe, he would not have done so, and the journey of Boromir was
doomed. Mithrandir never spoke to us of what was to be, nor did he reveal
his purposes. He got leave of Denethor, how I do not know, to look at the
secrets of our treasury, and I learned a little of him, when he would teach
(and that was seldom). Ever he would search and would question us above all
else concerning the Great Battle that was fought upon Dagorlad in the
beginning of Gondor, when He whom we do not name was overthrown. And
he was eager for stories of Isildur, though of him we had less to tell; for nothing
certain was ever known among us of his end.' Now Faramir's voice sank to a whisper. 'But this much I learned or
guessed, and I have kept it ever secret in my heart since: that Isildur took
somewhat from the hand of the Unnamed, ere he went away from Gondor,
never to be seen among mortal men again. Here I thought was the answer to
Mithrandir's questioning. But it seemed then a matter that concerned only
the seekers after ancient learning. Nor when the riddling words of our dream
were debated among us, did I think of Isildur's Bane as being this same
thing. For Isildur was ambushed and slain by ore-arrows, according to the
only legend that we knew, and Mithrandir had never told me more. 'What in truth this Thing is I cannot yet guess; but some heirloom of
power and peril it must be. A fell weapon, perchance, devised by the Dark
Ford. If it were a thing that gave advantage in battle. I can well believe
that Boromir, the proud and fearless, often rash, ever anxious for the
victory of Minas Tirith (and his own glory therein), might desire such a
thing and be allured by it. Alas that ever he went on that errand! I should
have been chosen by my father and the elders but he put himself forward, as
being the older and the hardier (both true), and he would not be stayed. 'But fear no more! I would not take this thing, if it layby the
highway. Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her,
so, using the weapon of the Dark Ford for her good and my glory. No. I do
not wish for such triumphs, Frodo son of Drogo.' 'Neither did the Council,' said Frodo. 'Nor do 1. 1 would have nothing
to do with such matters.' 'For myself,’ said Faramir, ’I would see the White Tree in flower again
in the courts of the kings, and the Silver Crown return, and Minas Tirith in
peace: Minas Anor again as of old, full of light, high and fair, beautiful
as a queen among other queens: not a mistress of many slaves, nay, not even
a kind mistress of willing slaves. War must be, while we defend our lives
against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword
for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his
glory. I love only that which they defend: the city of the Men of N®menor;
and I would have her loved for her memory, her ancientry, her beauty, and
her present wisdom. Not feared, save as men may fear the dignity of a man,
old and wise. 'So fear me not! I do not ask you to tell me more. I do not even ask
you to tell me whether I now speak nearer the mark. But if you will trust
me, it may be that I can advise you in your present quest, whatever that
be-yes, and even aid you.' Frodo made no answer. Almost he yielded to the desire for help and
counsel, to tell this grave young man, whose words seemed so wise and fair,
all that was in his mind. But something held him back. His heart was heavy
with fear and sorrow: if he and Sam were indeed, as seemed likely, all that
was now left of the Nine Walkers, then he was in sole command of the secret
of their errand. Better mistrust undeserved than rash words. And the memory
of Boromir, of the dreadful change that the lure of the Ring had worked in
him, was very present to his mind, when he looked at Faramir and listened to
his voice: unlike they were, and yet also much akin. They walked on in silence for a while, passing like grey and green
shadows under the old trees, their feet making no sound; above them many
birds sang, and the sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in the
evergreen woods of Ithilien. Sam had taken no part in the conversation, though he had listened; and
at the same time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft
woodland noises about them. One thing he had noted, that in all the talk the
name of Gollum had not once come up. He was glad, though he felt that it was
too much to hope that he would never hear it again. He soon became aware
also that though they walked alone, there were many men close at hand: not
only Damrod and Mablung flitting in and out of the shadows ahead, but others
on either side, all making their swift secret way to some appointed place. Once, looking suddenly back, as if some prickle of the skin told him
that he was watched from behind, he thought he caught a brief glimpse of a
small dark shape slipping behind a tree-trunk. He opened his mouth to speak
and shut it again. Tm not sure of it,' he said to himself, 'and why should
I remind them of the old villain, if they choose to forget him? I wish I
could!' So they passed on, until the woodlands grew thinner and the land began
to fall more steeply. Then they turned aside again, to the right, and came
quickly to a small river in a narrow gorge: it was the same stream that
trickled far above out of the round pool, now grown to a swift torrent,
leaping down over many stones in a deep-cloven bed, overhung with ilex and
dark box- woods. Looking west they could see, below them in a haze of light,
lowlands and broad meads, and glinting far off in the westering sun the wide
waters of the Anduin. 'Here, alas! I must do you a discourtesy,' said Faramir. "I hope you
will pardon it to one who has so far made his orders give way to courtesy as
not to slay you or to bind you. But it is a command that no stranger, not
even one of Rohan that fights with us, shall see the path we now go with
open eyes. I must blindfold you.’ 'As you will,' said Frodo. ’Even the Elves do likewise at need, and
blindfolded we crossed the borders of fair Lothlurien. Gimli the dwarf took
it ill, but the hobbits endured it.' 'It is to no place so fair that I shall lead you,' said Faramir. 'But I
am glad that you will take this willingly and not by force.' He called softly and immediately Mablung and Damrod stepped out of the
trees and came back to him. 'Blindfold these guests,' said Faramir.
'Securely, but not so as to discomfort them. Do not tie their hands. They
will give their word not to try and see. I could trust them to shut their
eyes of their own accord, but eyes will blink, if the feet stumble. Lead
them so that they do not falter.' With green scarves the two guards now bound up the hobbits' eyes and
drew their hoods down almost to their mouths; then quickly they took each
one by the hand and went on their way. All that Frodo and Sam knew of this
last mile of the road they learned from guessing in the dark. After a little
they found that they were on a path descending steeply; soon it grew so
narrow that they went in single file, brushing a stony wall on either side;
their guards steered them from behind with hands laid firmly on their
shoulders. Now and again they came to rough places and were lifted from
their feet for a while, and then set down again. Always the noise of the
running water was on their right hand, and it grew nearer and louder. At
length they were halted. Quickly Mablung and Damrod turned them about,
several times, and they lost all sense of direction. They climbed upwards a
little: it seemed cold and the noise of the stream had become faint. Then
they were picked up and carried down, down many steps, and round a corner.
Suddenly they heard the water again, loud now, rushing and splashing. All
round them it seemed, and they felt a fine rain on their hands and cheeks. At last they were set on their feet once more. For a moment they stood so,
half fearful, blindfold, not knowing where they were; and no one spoke. Then came the voice of Faramir close behind. 'Let them see! ' he said. The scarves were removed and their hoods drawn back, and they blinked and
gasped. They stood on a wet floor of polished stone, the doorstep, as it were,
of a rough-hewn gate of rock opening dark behind them. But in front a thin
veil of water was hung, so near that Frodo could have put an outstretched
arm into it. It faced westward. The level shafts of the setting sun behind
beat upon it, and the red light was broken into many flickering beams of
ever-changing colour. It was as if they stood at the window of some
elven-tower, curtained with threaded jewels of silver and gold, and ruby,
sapphire and amethyst, all kindled with an unconsuming fire. 'At least by good chance we came at the right hour to reward you for
your patience,' said Faramir. 'This is the Window of the Sunset, Henneth
Annyn, fairest of all the falls of Ithilien, land of many fountains. Few
strangers have ever seen it. But there is no kingly hall behind to match it. Enter now and see ! ’ Even as he spoke the sun sank, and the fire faded in the flowing water. They turned and passed under the low forbidding arch. At once they found
themselves in a rock-chamber, wide and rough, with an uneven stooping roof.
A few torches were kindled and cast a dim light on the glistening walls.
Many men were already there. Others were still coming in by twos and threes
through a dark narrow door on one side. As their eyes grew accustomed to the
gloom the hobbits saw that the cave was larger than they had guessed and was
filled with great store of arms and victuals. 'Well, here is our refuge,' said Faramir. 'Not a place of great ease
but here you may pass the night in peace. It is dry at least, and there is
food, though no fire. At one time the water flowed down through this cave
and out of the arch, but its course was changed further up the gorge, by
workmen of old, and the stream sent down in a fall of doubled height over
the rocks far above. All the ways into this grot were then sealed against
the entry of water or aught else, all save one. There are now but two ways
out: that passage yonder by which you entered blindfold, and through the
Window-curtain into a deep bowl filled with knives of stone. Now rest a
while, until the evening meal is set.' The hobbits were taken to a corner and given a low bed to lie on, if
they wished. Meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave, quietly and in
orderly quickness. Light tables were taken from the walls and set up on
trestles and laden with gear. This was plain and unadorned for the most
part, but all well and fairly, made: round platters, bowls and dishes of
glazed brown clay or turned box-wood, smooth and clean. Here and there was a
cup or basin of polished bronze; and a goblet of plain silver was set by the
Captain’s seat in the middle of the inmost table. Faramir went about among the men, questioning each as he came in, in a
soft voice. Some came back from the pursuit of the Southrons; others, left
behind as scouts near the road, came in latest. All the Southrons had been
accounted for, save only the great mymak: what happened to him none could
say. Of the enemy no movement could be seen; not even an ore-spy was
abroad. 'You saw and heard nothing, Anborn?' Faramir asked of the latest comer. 'Well, no, lord,’ said the man. 'No Ore at least. But I saw, or thought
I saw, something a little strange. It was getting deep dusk, when the eyes
make things greater than they should be. So perhaps it may have been no more
than a squirrel.’ Sam pricked up his ears at this. ’Yet if so, it was a
black squirrel, and I saw no tail. ’Twas like a shadow on the ground, and it
whisked behind a tree-trunk when I drew nigh and went up aloft as swift as
any squirrel could. You will not have us slay wild beasts for no purpose,
and it seemed no more, so I tried no arrow. It was too dark for sure
shooting anyway, and the creature was gone into the gloom of the leaves in a
twinkling. But I stayed for a while, for it seemed strange, and then I
hastened back. I thought I heard the thing hiss at me from high above as I
turned away. A large squirrel, maybe. Perhaps under the shadow of the
Unnamed some of the beasts of Mirkwood are wandering hither to our
woods. They have black squirrels there, ’tis said.’ 'Perhaps,' said Faramir. 'But that would be an ill omen, if it were so. We do not want the escapes of Mirkwood in Ithilien.’ Sam fancied that he
gave a swift glance towards the hobbits as he spoke; but Sam said nothing. For a while he and Frodo lay back and watched the torchlight, and the men
moving to and fro speaking in hushed voices. Then suddenly Frodo fell
asleep.
Sam struggled with himself, arguing this way and that. 'He may be all
right,' he thought, ’and then he may not. Fair speech may hide a foul
heart.' He yawned. V I could sleep for a week, and I'd be better for it. And
what can I do, if I do keep awake, me all alone, and all these great Men
about? Nothing, Sam Gamgee; but you've got to keep awake all the same.' And
somehow he managed it. The light faded from the cave door, and the grey veil
of falling water grew dim and was lost in gathering shadow. Always the sound
of the water went on, never changing its note, morning or evening or night. It murmured and whispered of sleep. Sam stuck his knuckles in his eyes. Now more torches were being lit. A cask of wine was broached. Storage
barrels were being opened. Men were fetching water from the fall. Some were
laving their hands in basins. A wide copper bowl and a white cloth were
brought to Faramir and he washed. 'Wake our guests,' he said, 'and take them water. It is time to eat.’ Frodo sat up and yawned and stretched. Sam, not used to being waited
on, looked with some surprise at the tall man who bowed, holding a basin of
water before him. 'Put it on the ground, master, if you please! ' he said. 'Easier for me
and you.' Then to the astonishment and amusement of the Men he plunged his
head into the cold water and splashed his neck and ears. 'Is it the custom in your land to wash the head before supper? ' said
the man who waited on the hobbits. 'No, before breakfast,' said Sam. 'But if you're short of sleep cold
water on the neck's like rain on a wilted lettuce. There! Now I can keep
awake long enough to eat a bit.' They were led then to seats beside Faramir: barrels covered with pelts
and high enough above the benches of the Men for their convenience. Before
they ate, Faramir and all his men turned and faced west in a moment of
silence. Faramir signed to Frodo and Sam that they should do likewise. 'So we always do.' he said, as they sat down: 'we look towards N®menor
that was, and beyond to Elvenhome that is, and to that which is beyond
Elvenhome and will ever be. Have you no such custom at meat? ’ 'No,' said Frodo, feeling strangely rustic and untutored. 'But if we
are guests, we bow to our host, and after we have eaten we rise and thank
him.' 'That we do also,' said Faramir. After so long journeying and camping, and days spent XJn the lonely
wild, the evening meal seemed a feast to the hobbits: to drink pale yellow
wine, cool and fragrant, and eat bread and butter, and salted meats, and
dried fruits, and good red cheese, with clean hands and clean knives and
plates. Neither Frodo nor Sam refused anything that was offered, nor a
second, nor indeed a third helping. The wine coursed in their veins and
tired limbs, and they felt glad and easy of heart as they had not done since
they left the land of Lurien. When all was done Faramir led them to a recess at the back of the cave,
partly screened by curtains; and a chair and two stools were brought there. A little earthenware lamp burned in a niche. 'You may soon desire to sleep,' he said, ’and especially good Samwise,
who would not close his eyes before he ate — whether for fear of blunting
the edge of a noble hunger, or for fear of me, I do not know. But it is not
good to sleep too soon after meat, and that following a fast. Let us talk a
while. On your journey from Rivendell there must have been many things to
tell. And you, too, would perhaps wish to learn something of us and the
lands where you now are. Tell me of Boromir my brother, and of old
Mithrandir, and of the fair people of Lothlurien.' Frodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk. But though the
food and wine had put him at his ease, he had not lost all his caution. Sam
was beaming and humming to himself, but when Frodo spoke he was at first
content to listen, only occasionally venturing to make an exclamation of
agreement. Frodo told many tales, yet always he steered the matter away from the
quest of the Company and from the Ring, enlarging rather on the valiant part
Boromir had played in all their adventures, with the wolves of the wild, in
the snows under Caradhras, and in the mines of Moria where Gandalf fell.
Faramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge. 'It must have irked Boromir to run from Ores,’ he said, 'or even from
the fell thing you name, the Balrog — even though he was the last to
leave.' 'Fie was the last,' said Frodo, 'but Aragorn was forced to lead us. Fie
alone knew the way after Gandalf s fall. But had there not been us lesser
folk to care for, I do not think that either he or Boromir would have fled.' 'Maybe, it would have been better had Boromir fallen there with
Mithrandir,' said Faramir, 'and not gone on to the fate that waited above
the falls of Rauros.'
'Maybe. But tell me now of your own fortunes,' said Frodo, turning the
matter aside once again. 'For I would learn more of Minas Ithil and
Osgiliath, and Minas Tirith the long-enduring. What hope have you for that
city in your long war? ' 'What hope have we? ' said Faramir. 'It is long since we had any hope. The sword of Elendil, if it returns indeed, may rekindle it, but I do not
think that it will do more than put off the evil day, unless other help
unlooked-for also comes, from Elves or Men. For the Enemy increases and we
decrease. We are a failing people, a springless autumn. 'The Men of N®menor were settled far and wide on the shores and seaward
regions of the Great Lands, but for the most part they fell into evils and
follies. Many became enamoured of the Darkness and the black arts; some
were given over wholly to idleness and ease, and some fought among themselves,
until they were conquered in their weakness by the wild men. 'It is not said that evil arts were ever practised in Gondor, or that
the Nameless One was ever named in honour there; and the old wisdom and
beauty brought out of the West remained long in the realm of the sons of
Elendil the Fair, and they linger there still. Yet even so it was Gondor
that brought about its own decay, falling by degrees into dotage, and
thinking that the Enemy was asleep, who was only banished not destroyed. 'Death was ever present, because the N®menoreans still, as they had in
their old kingdom, and so lost it, hungered after endless life unchanging. Kings made tombs more splendid than houses of the living, and counted old
names in the rolls of their descent dearer than the names of sons. Childless
lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry; in secret chambers withered men
compounded strong elixirs, or in high cold towers asked questions of the
stars. And the last king of the line of Anbrion had no heir. 'But the stewards were wiser and more fortunate. Wiser, for they
recruited the strength of our people from the sturdy folk of the sea -coast,
and from the hardy mountaineers of Ered Nimrais. And they made a truce with
the proud peoples of the North, who often had assailed us, men of fierce
valour, but our kin from afar off, unlike the wild Easterlings or the cruel
Haradrim. 'So it came to pass in the days of Cirion the Twelfth Steward (and my
father is the sit and twentieth) that they rode to our aid and at the great
Field of Celebrant they destroyed our enemies that had seized our northern
provinces. These are the Rohirrim, as we name them, masters of horses, and
we ceded to them the fields of Calenardhon that are since called Rohan; for
that province had long been sparsely peopled. And they became our allies,
and have ever proved true to us, aiding us at need, and guarding our
northern marches and the Gap of Rohan. 'Of our lore and manners they have learned what they would, and their
lords speak our speech at need; yet for the most part they hold by the ways
of their own fathers and to their own memories, and they speak among
themselves their own North tongue. And we love them: tall men and fair
women, valiant both alike, golden-haired, bright-eyed, and strong; they
remind us of the youth of Men, as they were in the Elder Days. Indeed it is
said by our lore-masters that they have from of old this affinity with us
that they are come from those same Three Houses of Men as were the
N®menoreans in their beginning not from Hador the Goldenhaired, the
Elf-friend, maybe, yet from such of his sons and people as went not over Sea
into the West, refusing the call. 'For so we reckon Men in our lore, calling them the High, or Men of the
West, which were N®menoreans; and the Middle Peoples, Men of the
Twilight, such as are the Rohirrim and their kin that dwell still far in the North;
and the Wild, the Men of Darkness. 'Yet now, if the Rohirrim are grown in some ways more like to us,
enhanced in arts and gentleness, we too have become more like to them, and
can scarce claim any longer the title High. We are become Middle Men, of the
Twilight, but with memory of other things. For as the Rohirrim do, we now
love war and valour as things good in themselves, both a sport and an end;
and though we still hold that a warrior should have more skills and
knowledge than only the craft of weapons and slaying, we esteem a warrior,
nonetheless, above men of other crafts. Such is the need of our days. So
even was my brother, Boromir: a man of prowess, and for that he was
accounted the best man in Gondor. And very valiant indeed he was: no heir of
Minas Tirith has for long years been so hardy in toil, so onward into
battle, or blown a mightier note on the Great Horn.' Faramir sighed and fell
silent for a while. 'You don't say much in all your tales about the Elves, sir,' said Sam,
suddenly plucking up courage. He had noted that Faramir seemed to refer to
Elves with reverence, and this even more than his courtesy, and his food and
wine, had won Sam's respect and quieted his suspicions. 'No indeed, Master Samwise,' said Faramir, 'for I am not learned in
Elven-lore. But there you touch upon another point in which we have changed,
declining from N®menor to Middle-earth. For as you may know, if
Mithrandir was your companion and you have spoken with Elrond, the Edain, the Fathers
of the N®menoreans, fought beside the Elves in the first wars, and were
rewarded by the gift of the kingdom in the midst of the Sea, within sight of
Elvenhome. But in Middle-earth Men and Elves became estranged in the days
of darkness, by the arts of the Enemy, and by the slow changes of time in which
each kind walked further down their sundered roads. Men now fear and
misdoubt the Elves, and yet know little of them. And we of Gondor grow like
other Men, like the men of Rohan; for even they, who are the foes of the
Dark Lord, shun the Elves and speak of the Golden Wood with dread. 'Yet there are among us still some who have dealings with the Elves
when they may, and ever and anon one will go in secret to Lurien, seldom to
return. Not I. For I deem it perilous now for mortal man wilfully to seek
out the Elder People. Yet I envy you that have spoken with the White Lady.’ 'The Lady of Lurien! Galadriel!' cried Sam. 'You should see her indeed
you should, sir. I am only a hobbit, and gardening's my job at home, sir, if
you understand me, and I'm not much good at poetry — not at making it: a
bit of a comic rhyme, perhaps, now and again, you know, but not real poetry
— so I can't tell you what I mean. It ought to be sung. You'd have to get
Strider, Aragorn that is, or old Mr. Bilbo, for that. But I wish I could
make a song about her. Beautiful she is, sir! Lovely! Sometimes like a great
tree in flower, sometimes like a white daffadowndilly, small and slender
like. Hard as di'monds, soft as moonlight. Warm as sunlight, cold as frost
in the stars. Proud and far-off as a snow -mountain, and as merry as any lass
I ever saw with daisies in her hair in springtime. But that's a lot o'
nonsense, and all wide of my mark.' 'Then she must be lovely indeed,' said Faramir. 'Perilously fair.' 'I don't know about perilous ,' said Sam. 'It strikes me that folk takes
their peril with them into Lurien, and finds it there because they've
brought it. But perhaps you could call her perilous, because she's so strong
in herself. You, you could dash yourself to pieces on her, like a ship on a
rock; or drownd yourself, like a hobbit in a river. But neither rock nor
river would be to blame. Now Boro — ' He stopped and went red in the face. 'Yes? Now Boromir you would say? ' said Faramir. 'What would you say?
He took his peril with him? ’ 'Yes sir, begging your pardon, and a fine man as your brother was if I
may say so. But you've been warm on the scent all along. Now I watched
Boromir and listened to him, from Rivendell all down the road — looking
after my master, as you'll understand, and not meaning any harm to Boromir
— and it's my opinion that in Lurien he first saw clearly what I guessed
sooner: what he wanted. From the moment he first saw it he wanted the
Enemy's Ring! ' 'Sam! ' cried Frodo aghast. He had fallen deep into his own thoughts
for a while, and came out of them suddenly and too late. 'Save me! ' said Sam turning white, and then flushing scarlet. 'There I
go again! When ever you open your big mouth you put your foot in it the
Gaffer used to say to me, and right enough. O dear, O dear! 'Now look here, sir! ' He turned, facing up to Faramir with all the
courage that he could muster. 'Don't you go taking advantage of my master
because his servant's no better than a fool. You've spoken very handsome all
along, put me off my guard, talking of Elves and all. But handsome is as
handsome does we say. Now's a chance to show your quality.' 'So it seems,' said Faramir, slowly and very softly, with a strange
smile. 'So that is the answer to all the riddles! The One Ring that was
thought to have perished from the world. And Boromir tried to take it by
force? And you escaped? And ran all the way — to me! And here in the wild I
have you: two halflings, and a host of men at my call, and the Ring of
Rings. A pretty stroke of fortune! A chance for Faramir, Captain of Gondor,
to show his quality! Ha!’ He stood up, very tall and stern, his grey eyes
glinting. Frodo and Sam sprang from their stools and set themselves side by side
with their backs to the wall, fumbling for their sword-hilts. There was a
silence. All the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in
wonder. But Faramir sat down again in his chair and began to laugh quietly,
and then suddenly became grave again. 'Alas for Boromir! It was too sore a trial! ' he said. 'How you have
increased my sorrow, you two strange wanderers from a far country, bearing
the peril of Men! But you are less judges of Men than I of Halflings. We are
truth-speakers, we men of Gondor. We boast seldom, and then perform, or die
in the attempt. Not if I found it on the highway would I take it I said. Even if I were such a man as to desire this thing, and even though I knew
not clearly what this thing was when I spoke, still I should take those
words as a vow, and be held by them. 'But I am not such a man. Or I am wise enough to know that there are
some perils from which a man must flee. Sit at peace! And be comforted,
Samwise. If you seem to have stumbled, think that it was fated to be so. Your heart is shrewd as well as faithful, and saw clearer than your eyes. For strange though it may seem, it was safe to declare this to me. It may
even help the master that you love. It shall turn to his good, if it is in
my power. So be comforted. But do not even name this thing again aloud. Once
is enough.' The hobbits came back to their seats and sat very quiet. Men turned
back to their drink and their talk, perceiving that their captain had had
some jest or other with the little guests, and that it was over. 'Well, Frodo, now at last we understand one another,' said Faramir. 'If
you took this thing on yourself, unwilling, at others' asking, then you have
pity and honour from me. And I marvel at you: to keep it hid and not to use
it. You are a new people and a new world to me. Are all your kin of like
sort? Your land must be a realm of peace and content, and there must
gardeners be in high honour.' 'Not all is well there,' said Frodo, 'but certainly gardeners are
honoured.' 'But folk must grow weary there, even in their gardens, as do all
things under the Sun of this world. And you are far from home and wayworn.
No more tonight. Sleep, both of you — in peace, if you can. Fear not! I do
not wish to see it, or touch it, or know more of it than I know (which is
enough), lest peril perchance waylay me and I fall lower in the test than
Frodo son of Drogo. Go now to rest — but first tell me only, if you will,
whither you wish to go, and what to do. For I must watch, and wait, and
think. Time passes. In the morning we must each go swiftly on the ways
appointed to us.’ Frodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed. Now
a great weariness came down on him like a cloud. He could dissemble and
resist no longer. ’I was going to find a way into Mordor,' he said faintly. 'I was going
to Gorgoroth. I must find the Mountain of Fire and cast the thing into the
gulf of Doom. Gandalf said so. I do not think I shall ever get there.' Faramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment. Then suddenly
he caught him as he swayed, and lifting him gently, carried him to the bed
and laid him there, and covered him warmly. At once he fell into a deep
sleep. Another bed was set beside him for his servant. Sam hesitated for a
moment, then bowing very low: 'Good night, Captain, my lord,' he said. 'You
took the chance, sir.' 'Did I so?’ said Faramir. 'Yes sir, and showed your quality: the very highest.' Faramir smiled. 'A pert servant, Master Samwise. But nay: the praise of
the praiseworthy is above all rewards. Yet there was naught in this to
praise. I had no lure or desire to do other than I have done.' 'Ah well, sir,' said Sam, 'you said my master had an elvish air and
that was good and true. But I can say this: you have an air too, sir, that
reminds me of, of — well, Gandalf, of wizards. 'Maybe,' said Faramir. 'Maybe you discern from far away the air of
N®menor. Good night!’
Chapter 6 . The Forbidden Pool Frodo woke to find Faramir bending over him. For a second old fears
seized him and he sat up and shrank away. 'There is nothing to fear,' said Faramir. 'Is it morning already? ' said Frodo yawning. 'Not yet, but night is drawing to an end, and the full moon is setting. Will you come and see it? Also there is a matter on which I desire your
counsel. I am sorry to rouse you from sleep, but will you come? ’ 'I will,' said Frodo, rising and shivering a little as he left the warm
blanket and pelts. It seemed cold in the fireless cave. The noise of the
water was loud in the stillness. He put on his cloak and followed Faramir. Sam, waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness, saw first his
master’s empty bed and leapt to his feet. Then he saw two dark figures,
Frodo and a man, framed against the archway, which was now filled with
pale white light. He hurried after them, past rows of men sleeping on
mattresses along the wall. As he went by the cave-mouth he saw that the
Curtain was now become a dazzling veil of silk and pearls and silver thread:
melting icicles of moonlight. But he did not pause to admire it, and turning
aside he followed his master through the narrow doorway in the wall of the
cave. They went first along a black passage, then up many wet steps, and so
came to a small flat landing cut in the stone and lit by the pale sky,
gleaming high above through a long deep shaft. From here two flights of
steps led: one going on, as it seemed, up on to the high bank of the stream;
the other turning away to the left. This they followed. It wound its way up
like a turret- stair. At last they came out of the stony darkness and looked about. They were
on a wide flat rock without rail or parapet. At their right, eastwards, the
torrent fell, splashing over many terraces, and then, pouring down a steep
race, it filled a smooth-hewn channel with a dark force of water flecked
with foam, and curling and rushing almost at their feet it plunged sheer
over the edge that yawned upon their left. A man stood there, near the
brink, silent, gazing down. Frodo turned to watch the sleek necks of the water as they curved and
dived. Then he lifted his eyes and gazed far away. The world was quiet and
cold, as if dawn were near. Far off in the West the full moon was sinking,
round and white. Pale mists shimmered in the great vale below: a wide gulf
of silver fume, beneath which rolled the cool night-waters of the Anduin. A
black darkness loomed beyond, and in it glinted, here and there, cold,
sharp, remote, white as the teeth of ghosts, the peaks of Ered Nimrais, the
White Mountains of the Realm of Gondor, tipped with everlasting snow. For a while Frodo stood there on the high stone, and a shiver ran
through him, wondering if anywhere in the vastness of the night -lands his
old companions walked or slept, or lay dead shrouded in mist. Why was he
brought here out of forgetful sleep? Sam was eager for an answer to the same question and could not refrain
himself from muttering, for his master's ear alone as he thought: ’It's a
fine view, no doubt, Mr. Frodo, but chilly to the heart, not to mention the
bones ! What's going on? ’ Faramir heard and answered. 'Moonset over Gondor. Fair Ithil as he goes
from Middle-earth, glances upon the white locks of old Mindolluin. It is
worth a few shivers. But that is not what I brought you to see-though as for
you, Samwise, you were not brought, and do but pay the penalty of your
watchfulness. A draught of wine shall amend it. Come, look now! ' Fie stepped up beside the silent sentinel on the dark edge, and Frodo
followed. Sam hung back. He already felt insecure enough on this high wet
platform. Faramir and Frodo looked down. Far below them they saw the white
waters pour into a foaming bowl, and then swirl darkly about a deep oval
basin in the rocks, until they found their way out again through a narrow
gate, and flowed away, fuming and chattering, into calmer and more level
reaches. The moonlight still slanted down to the fall's foot and gleamed on
the ripples of the basin. Presently Frodo was aware of a small dark thing on
the near bank, but even as he looked at it, it dived and vanished just
beyond the boil and bubble of the fall, cleaving the black water as neatly
as an arrow or an edgewise stone. Faramir turned to the man at his side. 'Now what would you say that it
is, Anborn? A squirrel, or a kingfisher? Are there black kingfishers in the
night-pools of Mirkwood? ' v 'Tis not a bird, whatever else it be,' answered Anborn. 'It has four
limbs and dives manwise; a pretty mastery of the craft it shows, too. What
is it at? Seeking a way up behind the Curtain to our hidings? It seems we
are discovered at last. I have my bow here, and I have posted other archers,
nigh as good marksmen as myself, on either bank. We wait only for your
command to shoot, Captain.' 'Shall we shoot? ' said Faramir, turning quickly to Frodo. Frodo did not answer for a moment. Then 'No! ’ he said. 'No! I beg you
not to.’ If Sam had dared, he would have said 'Yes,' quicker and louder. He
could not see, but he guessed well enough from their words what they were
looking at. 'You know, then, what this thing is? ' said Faramir. 'Come, now you
have seen, tell me why it should be spared. In all our words together you
have not once spoken of your gangrel companion, and I let him be for the
time. He could wait till he was caught and brought before me. I sent my
keenest huntsmen to seek him, but he slipped them, and they had no sight of
him till now, save Anborn here, once at dusk y esterevening. But now he has
done worse trespass than only to go coney-snaring in the uplands: he has
dared to come to Henneth Annyn, and his life is forfeit. I marvel at the
creature: so secret and so sly as he is, to come sporting in the pool before
our very window. Does he think that men sleep without watch all night? Why
does he so?’ 'There are two answers, I think,' said Frodo. 'For one thing, he knows
little of Men, and sly though he is, your refuge is so hidden that perhaps
he does not know that Men are concealed here. For another, I think he is
allured here by a mastering desire, stronger than his caution.' 'He is lured here, you say? ' said Faramir in a low voice. 'Can he,
does he then know of your burden? ’ 'Indeed yes. He bore it himself for many years.’ 'He bore it? ' said Faramir, breathing sharply in his wonder. 'This
matter winds itself ever in new riddles. Then he is pursuing it? ’ 'Maybe. It is precious to him. But I did not speak of that.' 'What then does the creature seek? ' 'Fish,' said Frodo. 'Look! ’ They peered down at the dark pool. A little black head appeared at the
far end of the basin, just out of the deep shadow of the rocks. There was a
brief silver glint, and a swirl of tiny ripples. It swam to the side, and
then with marvellous agility a froglike figure climbed out of the water and
up the bank. At once it sat down and began to gnaw at the small silver thing
that glittered as it turned: the last rays of the moon were now falling
behind the stony wall at the pool's end. Faramir laughed softly. 'Fish! ' he said. 'It is a less perilous
hunger. Or maybe not: fish from the pool of Henneth Annyn may cost him all
he has to give.’ 'Now I have him at the arrow-point,' said Anborn. 'Shall I not shoot,
Captain? For coming unbidden to this place death is our law.' 'Wait, Anborn,' said Faramir. 'This is a harder matter than it seems. What have you to say now, Frodo? Why should we spare? ’ 'The creature is wretched and hungry,’ said Frodo, 'and unaware of his
danger. And Gandalf, your Mithrandir, he would have bidden you not to slay
him for that reason, and for others. He forbade the Elves to do so. I do not
know clearly why, and of what I guess I cannot speak openly out here. But
this creature is in some way bound up with my errand. Until you found us and
took us, he was my guide.' 'Your guide! ' said Faramir. 'The matter becomes ever stranger. I would
do much for you, Frodo, but this I cannot grant: to let this sly wanderer go
free at his own will from here, to join you later if it please him, or to be
caught by Ores and tell all he knows under threat of pain. He must be slain
or taken. Slain, if he be not taken very swiftly. But how can this slippery
thing of many guises be caught, save by a feathered shaft? ’ 'Let me go down quietly to him,’ said Frodo. 'You may keep your bows
bent, and shoot me at least, if I fail. I shall not run away.’ 'Go then and be swift! ’ said Faramir. 'If he comes off alive, he
should be your faithful servant for the rest of his unhappy days. Lead Frodo
down to the bank, Anborn, and go softly. The thing has a nose and ears. Give
me your bow.' Anborn grunted and led the way down the winding stair to the landing,
and then up the other stair, until at last they came to a narrow opening
shrouded with thick bushes. Passing silently through, Frodo found himself on
the top of the southern bank above the pool. It was now dark and the falls
were pale and grey, reflecting only the lingering moonlight of the western
sky. He could not see Gollum. He went forward a short way and Anborn
came softly behind him. 'Goon! ' he breathed in Frodo's ear. 'Have a care to your right. If
you fall in the pool, then no one but your fishing friend can help you. And
forget not that there are bowmen near at hand, though you may not see them.’
Frodo crept forward, using his hands Gollum-like to feel his way and to
steady himself. The rocks were for the most part flat and smooth but
slippery. He halted listening. At first he could hear no sound but the
unceasing rush of the fall behind him. Then presently he heard, not far
ahead, a hissing murmur. ’Fissh, nice fissh. White Face has vanished, my precious, at last, yes. Now we can eat fish in peace. No, not in peace, precious. For Precious is
lost; yes, lost. Dirty hobbits, nasty hobbits. Gone and left us, gollum; and
Precious is gone. Only poor Smjagol all alone. No Precious. Nasty Men,
they'll take it, steal my Precious. Thieves. We hates them. Fissh, nice
fissh: Makes us strong. Makes eyes bright, fingers tight, yes. Throttle
them, precious. Throttle them all, yes, if we gets chances. Nice fissh. Nice
fissh! ' So it went on, almost as unceasing as the waterfall, only interrupted
by a faint noise of slavering and gurgling. Frodo shivered, listening with
pity and disgust. He wished it would stop, and that he never need hear that
voice again. Anborn was not far behind. He could creep back and ask him to
get the huntsmen to shoot. They would probably get close enough, while
Gollum was gorging and off his guard. Only one true shot, and Frodo would be
rid of the miserable voice for ever. But no, Gollum had a claim on him now.
The servant has a claim on the master for service, even service in fear. They would have foundered in the Dead Marshes but for Gollum. Frodo
knew, too, somehow, quite clearly that Gandalf would not have wished it. 'Smjagol! ' he said softly. 'Fissh, nice fissh,’ said the voice. 'Smjagol! ’ he said, a little louder. The voice stopped. 'Smjagol, Master has come to look for you. Master is here. Come,
Smjagol! ' There was no answer but a soft hiss, as of intaken breath. 'Come, Smjagol! ' said Frodo. 'We are in danger. Men will kill you, if
they find you here. Come quickly, if you wish to escape death. Come to
Master!' 'No!' said the voice. 'Not nice Master. Leaves poor Smjagol and goes
with new friends. Master can wait. Smjagol hasn't finished.' 'There's no time,' said Frodo. 'Bring fish with you. Come! ’ 'No! Must finish fish.' 'Smjagol! ' said Frodo desperately. 'Precious will be angry. I shall
take Precious, and I shall say: make him swallow the bones and choke. Never
taste fish again. Come, Precious is waiting! ' There was a sharp hiss. Presently out of the darkness Gollum came
crawling on all fours, like an erring dog called to heel. He had a
half-eaten fish in his mouth and another in his hand. He came close to
Frodo, almost nose to nose, and sniffed at him. His pale eyes were shining.
Then he took the fish out of his mouth and stood up. 'Nice Master! ' he whispered. 'Nice hobbit, come back to poor Smjagol.
Good Smjagol comes. Now let's go, go quickly, yes. Through the trees, while
the Faces are dark. Yes, come let's go! ' 'Yes, we'll go soon,' said Frodo. 'But not at once. I will go with you
as I promised. I promise again. But not now. You are not safe yet. I will
save you, but you must trust me.’ 'We must trust Master? ’ said Gollum doubtfully. 'Why? Why not go at
once? Where is the other one, the cross rude hobbit? Where is he?' 'Away up there,' said Frodo, pointing to the waterfall. 'I am not going
without him. We must go back to him.' His heart sank. This was too much like
trickery. He did not really fear that Faramir would allow Gollum to be
killed, but he would probably make him prisoner and bind him; and certainly
what Frodo did would seem a treachery to the poor treacherous creature. It
would probably be impossible ever to make him understand or believe that
Frodo had saved his life in the only way he could. What else could he do? —
to keep faith, as near as might be, with both sides. 'Come!' he said. 'Or
the Precious will be angry. We are going back now, up the stream. Go on, go
on, you go in front! ’ Gollum crawled along close to the brink for a little way, snuffling and
suspicious. Presently he stopped and raised his head. 'Something's there! '
he said. 'Not a hobbit.’ Suddenly he turned back. A green light was
flickering in his bulging eyes. 'Masster, masster!' he hissed. 'Wicked!
Tricksy! False!' He spat and stretched out his long arms with white snapping
fingers. At that moment the great black shape of Anborn loomed up behind him and
came down on him. A large strong hand took him in the nape of the neck and
pinned him. He twisted round like lightning, all wet and slimy as he was,
wriggling like an eel, biting and scratching like a cat. But two more men
came up out of the shadows. 'Hold still! ' said one. 'Or we'll stick you as full of pins as a
hedgehog. Hold still!' Gollum went limp, and began to whine and weep. They tied him, none too
gently. 'Easy, easy! ' said Frodo. 'He has no strength to match you. Don't hurt
him, if you can help it. He'll be quieter, if you don't. Smjagol! They won't
hurt you. I'll go with you, and you shall come to no harm. Not unless they
kill me too. Trust Master! ' Gollum turned and spat at him. The men picked him up, put a hood over
his eyes, and carried him off. Frodo followed them, feeling very wretched. They went through the
opening behind the bushes, and back, down the stairs and passages, into the
cave. Two or three torches had been lit. Men were stirring. Sam was there,
and he gave a queer look at the limp bundle that the men carried. 'Got him?’
he said to Frodo. 'Yes. Well no, I didn't get him. He came to me, because he trusted me
at first, I'm afraid. I did not want him tied up like this. I hope it will
be all right; but I hate the whole business.' 'So do I,’ said Sam. 'And nothing will ever be all right where that
piece of misery is.’ A man came and beckoned to the hobbits, and took them to the recess at
the back of the cave. Faramir was sitting there in his chair, and the lamp
had been rekindled in its niche above his head. He signed to them to sit
down on the stools beside him. 'Bring wine for the guests,' he said. 'And
bring the prisoner to me.' The wine was brought, and then Anborn came carrying Gollum. He
removed the cover from Gollum's head and set him on his feet standing behind him to
support him. Gollum blinked, hooding the malice of his eyes with their heavy
pale lids. A very miserable creature he looked, dripping and dank, smelling
of fish (he still clutched one in his hand); his sparse locks were hanging
like rank weed over his bony brows, his nose was snivelling. 'Foose us! Foose us! ’ he said. 'The cord hurts us, yes it does, it
hurts us, and we've done nothing.' 'Nothing? ' said Faramir, looking at the wretched creature with a keen
glance, but without any expression in his face either of anger, or pity, or
wonder. 'Nothing? Have you never done anything worthy of binding or of worse
punishment? However, that is not for me to judge, happily. But tonight you
have come where it is death to come. The fish of this pool are dearly
bought.' Gollum dropped the fish from his hand. 'Don't want fish,' he said. 'The price is not set on the fish,' said Faramir. 'Only to come here
and look on the pool bears the penalty of death. I have spared you so far at
the prayer of Frodo here, who says that of him at least you have deserved
some thanks. But you must also satisfy me. What is your name? Whence do
you come? And whither do you go? What is your business? ’ 'We are lost, lost,' said Gollum. 'No name, no business, no Precious,
nothing. Only empty. Only hungry; yes, we are hungry. A few little fishes,
nasty bony little fishes, for a poor creature, and they say death. So wise
they are; so just, so very just.' 'Not very wise,' said Faramir. 'But just: yes perhaps, as just as our
little wisdom allows. Unloose him Frodo! ' Faramir took a small nail -knife
from his belt and handed it to Frodo. Gollum misunderstanding the gesture,
squealed and fell down. 'Now, Smjagol! ' said Frodo. 'You must trust me. I will not desert you.
Answer truthfully, if you can. It will do you good not harm.' He cut the
cords on Gollum's wrists and ankles and raised him to his feet. 'Come hither! ' said Faramir. 'Look at me! Do you know the name of this
place? Have you been here before? ’ Slowly Gollum raised his eyes and looked unwillingly into Faramir's. All light went out of them, and they stared bleak and pale for a moment into
the clear unwavering eyes of the man of Gondor. There was a still silence.
Then Gollum dropped his head and shrank down, until he was squatting on the
floor, shivering. 'We doesn't know and we doesn't want to know,' he
whimpered. 'Never came here; never come again.' 'There are locked doors and closed windows in your mind, and dark rooms
behind them,' said Faramir. 'But in this I judge that you speak the truth. It is well for you. What oath will you swear never to return; and never to
lead any living creature hither by word or sign?’ 'Master knows,' said Gollum with a sidelong glance at Frodo. 'Yes, he
knows. We will promise Master, if he saves us. We'll promise to It, yes.' He
crawled to Frodo's feet. 'Save us, nice Master! ' he whined. 'Smjagol
promises to Precious, promises faithfully. Never come again, never speak, no
never! No, precious, no!' 'Are you satisfied? ' said Faramir. 'Yes,' said Frodo. 'At least, you must either accept this promise or
carry out your law. You will get no more. But I promised that if he came to
me, he should not be harmed. And I would not be proved faithless.' Faramir sat for a moment in thought. 'Very good,' he said at last. 'I
surrender you to your master, to Frodo son of Drogo. Let him declare what he
will do with you ! ’ 'But, Lord Faramir,' said Frodo bowing, 'you have not yet declared your
will concerning the said Frodo, and until that is made known, he cannot
shape his plans for himself or his companions. Your judgement was postponed
until the morning; but that is now at hand.’ 'Then I will declare my doom,' said Faramir. 'As for you, Frodo, in so
far as lies in me under higher authority, I declare you free in the realm
of, Gondor to the furthest of its ancient bounds; save only that neither you
nor any that go with you have leave to come to this place unbidden. This
doom shall stand for a year and a day, and then cease, unless you shall
before that term come to Minas Tirith and present yourself to the Lord and
Steward of the City. Then I will entreat him to confirm what I have done and
to make it lifelong. In the meantime, whomsoever you take under your
protection shall be under my protection and under the shield of Gondor. Are
you answered? ’ Frodo bowed low. ’I am answered,' he said, 'and I place myself at your
service, if that is of any worth to one so high and honourable.’ 'It is of great worth,' said Faramir. 'And now, do you take this
creature, this Smjagol, under your protection? ' 'I do take Smjagol under my protection,' said Frodo. Sam sighed
audibly; and not at the courtesies, of which, as any hobbit would, he
thoroughly approved. Indeed in the Shire such a matter would have required a
great many more words and bows. 'Then I say to you,' said Faramir, turning to Gollum, 'you are under
doom of death; but while you walk with Frodo you are safe for our part. Yet
if ever you be found by any man of Gondor astray without him, the doom shall
fall. And may death find you swiftly, within Gondor or without, if you do
not well serve him. Now answer me: whither would you go? You were his
guide, he says. Whither were you leading him? ' Gollum made no reply.
'This I will not have secret,' said Faramir. 'Answer me, or I will
reverse my judgement! ’ Still Gollum did not answer. 'I will answer for him,' said Frodo. 'He brought me to the Black Gate,
as I asked; but it was impassable.' 'There is no open gate into the Nameless Land,’ said Faramir. 'Seeing this, we turned aside and came by the Southward road ’ Frodo
continued; 'for he said that there is, or there may be, a path near to Minas
Ithil . ' 'Minas Morgul,' said Faramir. 'I do not know clearly,' said Frodo; 'but the path climbs, I think, up
into the mountains on the northern side of that vale where the old city
stands. It goes up to a high cleft and so down to — that which is beyond.’ 'Do you know the name of that high pass? ’ said Faramir. 'No,' said Frodo. 'It is called Cirith Ungol.' Gollum hissed sharply and began muttering
to himself. 'Is not that its name? ’ said Faramir turning to him. 'No! ' said Gollum, and then he squealed, as if something had stabbed
him. 'Yes, yes, we heard the name once. But what does the name matter to us?
Master says he must get in. So we must try some way. There is no other way
to try, no.' 'No other way? 'said Faramir. 'How do you know that? And who has
explored all the confines of that dark realm? ' He looked long and
thoughtfully at Gollum. Presently he spoke again. 'Take this creature away,
Anborn. Treat him gently, but watch him. And do not you, Smjagol, try to
dive into the falls. The rocks have such teeth there as would slay you
before your time. Leave us now and take your fish! ' Anborn went out and Gollum went cringing before him. The curtain was
drawn across the recess. 'Frodo, I think you do very unwisely in this,' said Faramir. 'I do not
think you should go with this creature. It is wicked.' 'No, not altogether wicked,' said Frodo. 'Not wholly, perhaps,' said Faramir; 'but malice eats it like a canker,
and the evil is growing. He will lead you to no good. If you will part with
him, I will give him safe-conduct and guidance to any point on the borders
of Gondor that he may name.' 'He would not take it,' said Frodo. 'He would follow after me as he
long has done. And I have promised many times to take him under my
protection and to go where he led. You would not ask me to break faith with
him?' 'No,' said Faramir. 'But my heart would. For it seems less evil to
counsel another man to break troth than to do so oneself, especially if one
sees a friend bound unwitting to his own harm. But no — if he will go with
you, you must now endure him. But I do not think you are holden to go to
Cirith Ungol, of which he has told you less than he knows. That much I
perceived clearly in his mind. Do not go to Cirith Ungol!' 'Where then shall I go? ' said Frodo. 'Back to the Black Gate and
deliver myself up to the guard? What do you know against this place that
makes its name so dreadful? ’ 'Nothing certain,' said Faramir. 'We of Gondor do not ever pass east of
the Road in these days, and none of us younger men has ever done so, nor has
any of us set foot upon the Mountains of Shadow. Of them we know only old
report and the rumour of bygone days. But there is some dark terror that
dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul. If Cirith Ungol is named, old men
and masters of lore will blanch and fall silent. ,The valley of Minas Morgul passed into evil very long ago, and it was
a menace and a dread while the banished Enemy dwelt yet far away, and
Ithilien was still for the most part in our keeping. As you know, that city
was once a strong place, proud and fair, Minas Ithil, the twin sister of our
own city. But it was taken by fell men whom the Enemy in his first strength
had dominated, and who wandered homeless and masterless after his fall. It
is said that their lords were men of N®menor who had fallen into dark
wickedness; to them the Enemy had given rings of power, and he had
devoured them: living ghosts they were become, terrible and evil. After his going
they took Minas Ithil and dwelt there, and they filled it, and all the
valley about, with decay: it seemed empty and was not so, for a shapeless
fear lived within the ruined walls. Nine Lords there were, and after the
return of their Master, which they aided and prepared in secret, they grew
strong again. Then the Nine Riders issued forth from the gates of horror,
and we could not withstand them. Do not approach their citadel. You will be
espied. It is a place of sleepless malice, full of lidless eyes. Do not go
that way! ' 'But where else will you direct me? ' said Frodo. 'You cannot yourself,
you say, guide me to the mountains, nor over them. But over the mountains I
am bound, by solemn undertaking to the Council, to find a way or perish in
the seeking. And if I turn back, refusing the road in its bitter end, where
then shall I go among Elves or Men? Would you have me come to Gondor
with this Thing, the Thing that drove your brother mad with desire? What spell
would it work in Minas Tirith? Shall there be two cities of Minas Morgul,
grinning at each other across a dead land filled with rottenness? ' 'I would not have it so,' said Faramir. 'Then what would you have me do? ' 'I know not. Only I would not have you go to death or to torment. And I
do not think that Mithrandir would have chosen this way.' 'Yet since he is gone, I must take such paths as I can find. And there
is no time for long searching,' said Frodo. 'It is a hard doom and a hopeless errand,' said Faramir. 'But at the
least, remember my warning: beware of this guide, Smjagol. He has done
murder before now. I read it in him.' He sighed. 'Well, so we meet and part, Frodo son of Drogo. You have no need of
soft words: I do not hope to see you again on any other day under this Sun.
But you shall go now with my blessing upon you, and upon all your people.
Rest a little while food is prepared for you. ’I would gladly learn how this creeping Smjagol became possessed of the
Thing of which we speak, and how he lost it, but I will not trouble you now.
If ever beyond hope you return to the lands of the living and we retell our
tales, sitting by a wall in the sun, laughing at old grief, you shall tell
me then. Until that time, or some other time beyond the vision of the
Seeing-stones of N®menor, farewell! ’ He rose and bowed low to Frodo, and drawing the curtain passed out into
the cave.
Chapter 7. Journey to the Cross-roads Frodo and Sam returned to their beds and lay there in silence resting
for a little, while men bestirred themselves and the business of the day
began. After a while water was brought to them, and then they were led to a
table where food was set for three. Faramir broke his fast with them. He had
not slept since the battle on the day before, yet he did not look weary. When they had finished they stood up. 'May no hunger trouble you on the
road,' said Faramir. 'You have little provision, but some small store of
food fit for travellers I have ordered to be stowed in your packs. You will
have no lack of water as you walk in Ithilien, but do not drink of any
stream that flows from Imlad Morgul, the Valley of Living Death. This also I
must tell you. My scouts and watchers have all returned, even some that have
crept within sight of the Morannon. They all find a strange thing. The land
is empty. Nothing is on the road, and no sound of foot, or horn, or
bowstring is anywhere to be heard. A waiting silence broods above the
Nameless Land. I do not know what this portends. But the time draws swiftly
to some great conclusion. Storm is coming. Hasten while you may! If you are
ready, let us go. The Sun will soon rise above the shadow.’ The hobbits' packs were brought to them (a little heavier than they had
been), and also two stout staves of polished wood, shod with iron, and with
carven heads through which ran plaited leathern thongs. 'I have no fitting gifts to give you at our parting,' said Faramir; 'but take these staves. They may be of service to those who walk or climb in
the wild. The men of the White Mountains use them; though these have been
cut down to your height and newly shod. They are made of the fair tree
lebethron, beloved of the woodwrights of Gondor, and a virtue has been set
upon them of finding and returning. May that virtue not wholly fail under
the Shadow into which you go!’ The hobbits bowed low. 'Most gracious host,' said Frodo, 'it was said
to me by Elrond Halfelven that I should find friendship upon the way, secret
and unlooked for. Certainly I looked for no such friendship as you have
shown. To have found it turns evil to great good.' Now they made ready to depart. Gollum was brought out of some corner or
hiding-hole, and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been,
though he kept close to Frodo and avoided the glance of Faramir. 'Your guide must be blindfolded,' said Faramir, 'but you and your
servant Samwise I release from this, if you wish.' Gollum squealed, and squirmed, and clutched at Frodo, when they came to
bind his eyes; and Frodo said: 'Blindfold us all three, and cover up my eyes
first, and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant.' This was done,
and they were led from the cave of Henneth Annyn. After they had passed the
passages and stairs they felt the cool morning air, fresh and sweet, about
them. Still blind they went on for some little time, up and then gently
down. At last the voice of Faramir ordered them to be uncovered. They stood under the boughs of the woods again. No noise of the falls
could be heard, for a long southward slope lay now between them and the
ravine in which the stream flowed. To the west they could see light through
the trees, as if the world came there to a sudden end, at a brink looking
out only on to sky. 'Here is the last parting of our ways,' said Faramir. 'If you take my
counsel, you will not turn eastward yet. Go straight on, for thus you will
have the cover of the woodland for many miles. On your west is an edge where
the land falls into the great vales, sometimes suddenly and sheer, sometimes
in long hillsides. Keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest. In
the beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight, I think. The land
dreams in a false peace, and for a while all evil is withdrawn. Fare you
well, while you may!' He embraced the hobbits then, after the manner of his people, stooping,
and placing his hands upon their shoulders, and kissing their foreheads. 'Go
with the good will of all good men!' he said. They bowed to the ground. Then he turned and without looking back he
left them and went to his two guards that stood at a little distance away. They marvelled to see with what speed these green -clad men now moved,
vanishing almost in the twinkling of an eye. The forest where Faramir had
stood seemed empty and drear, as if a dream had passed. Frodo sighed and turned back southward. As if to mark his disregard of
all such courtesy, Gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree.
'Hungry again already?' thought Sam. 'Well, now for it again!’ 'Have they gone at last? ' said Gollum. 'Nassty wicked Men! Smjagol's
neck still hurts him, yes it does. Let's go! ' 'Yes, let us go,' said Frodo. 'But if you can only speak ill of those
who showed you mercy, keep silent! ' 'Nice Master! ' said Gollum. 'Smjagol was only joking. Always forgives,
he does, yes, yes, even nice Master's little trickses. Oh yes, nice Master,
nice Smjagol! ' Frodo and Sam did not answer. Hoisting their packs and taking their
staves in hand, they passed on into the woods of Ithilien. Twice that day they rested and took a little of the food provided by
Faramir: dried fruits and salted meat, enough for many days; and bread
enough to last while it was still fresh. Gollum ate nothing. The sun rose and passed overhead unseen, and began to sink, and the
light through the trees to the west grew golden; and always they walked in
cool green shadow, and all about them was silence. The birds seemed all to
have flown away or to have fallen dumb. Darkness came early to the silent woods, and before the fall of night
they halted, weary, for they had walked seven leagues or more from Henneth
Annyn. Frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep mould beneath an
ancient tree. Sam beside him was more uneasy: he woke many times, but there
was never a sign of Gollum, who had slipped off as soon as the others had
settled to rest. Whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearby, or had
wandered restlessly prowling through the night, he did not say; but he
returned with the first glimmer of light, and roused his companions. 'Must get up, yes they must!’ he said. 'Long ways to go still, south
and east. Hobbits must make haste!' That day passed much as the day before had gone, except that the
silence seemed deeper; the air grew heavy, and it began to be stifling under
the trees. It felt as if thunder was brewing. Gollum often paused, sniffing
the air, and then he would mutter to himself and urge them to greater speed. As the third stage of their day's march drew on and afternoon waned,
the forest opened out, and the trees became larger and more scattered. Great
ilexes of huge girth stood dark and solemn in wide glades with here and
there among them hoary ash-trees, and giant oaks just putting out their
brown-green buds. About them lay long launds of green grass dappled with
celandine and anemones, white and blue, now folded for sleep; and there were
acres populous with the leaves of woodland hyacinths: already their sleek
bell-stems were thrusting through the mould. No living creature, beast or
bird, was to be seen, but in these open places Gollum grew afraid, and they
walked now with caution, flitting from one long shadow to another.
Light was fading fast when they came to the forest-end. There they sat
under an old gnarled oak that sent its roots twisting like snakes down a
steep crumbling bank. A deep dim valley lay before them. On its further side
the woods gathered again, blue and grey under the sullen evening, and
marched on southwards. To the right the Mountains of Gondor glowed,
remote in the West, under a fire-flecked sky. To the left lay darkness: the
towering walls of Mordor; and out of that darkness the long valley came,
falling steeply in an ever-widening trough towards the Anduin. At its bottom
ran a hurrying stream: Frodo could hear its stony voice coming up through
the silence; and beside it on the hither side a road went winding down like
a pale ribbon, down into chill grey mists that no gleam of sunset touched.
There it seemed to Frodo that he descried far off, floating as it were on a
shadowy sea, the high dim tops and broken pinnacles of old towers forlorn
and dark. Fie turned to Gollum. 'Do you know where we are? ' he said. 'Yes, Master. Dangerous places. This is the road from the Tower of the
Moon, Master, down to the ruined city by the shores of the River. The ruined
city, yes, very nasty place, full of enemies. We shouldn't have taken Men's
advice. Hobbits have come a long way out of the path. Must go east now, away
up there.' He waved his skinny arm towards the darkling mountains. 'And we
can't use this road. Oh no! Cruel peoples come this way, down from the
Tower.' Frodo looked down on to the road. At any rate nothing was moving on it
now. It appeared lonely and forsaken, running down to empty ruins in the
mist. But there was an evil feeling in the air, as if things might indeed be
passing up and down that eyes could not see. Frodo shuddered as he looked
again at the distant pinnacles now dwindling into night, and the sound of
the water seemed cold and cruel: the voice of Morgulduin, the polluted
stream that flowed from the Valley of the Wraiths. 'What shall we do? ' he said. 'We have walked long and far. Shall we
look for some place in the woods behind where we can lie hidden? ' 'No good hiding in the dark,' said Gollum. 'It's in day that hobbits
must hide now, yes in day.' 'Oh come! ' said Sam. 'We must rest for a bit, even if we get up again
in the middle of the night. There'll still be hours of dark then time enough
for you to take us a long march, if you know the way.'
Gollum reluctantly agreed to this, and he turned back towards the
trees, working eastward for a while along the straggling edges of the wood. He would not rest on the ground so near the evil road, and after some debate
they all climbed up into the crotch of a large holm-oak, whose thick
branches springing together from the trunk made a good hiding-place and a
fairly comfortable refuge. Night fell and it grew altogether dark under the
canopy of the tree. Frodo and Sam drank a little water and ate some bread
and dried fruit, but Gollum at once curled up and went to sleep. The hobbits
did not shut their eyes. It must have been a little after midnight when Gollum woke up: suddenly
they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them. He listened and
sniffed, which seemed, as they had noticed before, his usual method of
discovering the time of night. 'Are we rested? Have we had beautiful sleep?' he said. 'Let's go!' 'We aren't, and we haven't,' growled Sam. 'But we'll go if we must.' Gollum dropped at once from the branches of the tree on to all fours,
and the hobbits followed more slowly. As soon as they were down they went on again with Gollum leading,
eastwards, up the dark sloping land. They could see little, for the night
was now so deep that they were hardly aware of the stems of trees before
they stumbled against them. The ground became more broken and walking
was more difficult, but Gollum seemed in no way troubled. He led them through
thickets and wastes of brambles; sometimes round the lip of a deep cleft or
dark pit, sometimes down into black bush-shrouded hollows and out again; but
if ever they went a little downward, always the further slope was longer and
steeper. They were climbing steadily. At their first halt they looked back,
and they could dimly perceive the roofs of the forest they had left behind
lying like a vast dense shadow, a darker night under the dark blank sky.
There seemed to be a great blackness looming slowly out of the East, eating
up the faint blurred stars. Later the sinking moon escaped from the pursuing
cloud, but it was ringed all about with a sickly yellow glare. At last Gollum turned to the hobbits. 'Day soon,' he said. 'Hobbits
must hurry. Not safe to stay in the open in these places. Make haste! ' He quickened his pace, and they followed him wearily. Soon they began
to climb up on to a great hog-back of land. For the most part it was covered
with a thick growth of gorse and whortleberry, and low tough thorns, though
here and there clearings opened, the scars of recent fires. The gorse-bushes
became more frequent as they got nearer the top; very old and tall they
were, gaunt and leggy below but thick above, and already putting out yellow
flowers that glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent. So tall
were the spiny thickets that the hobbits could walk upright under them,
passing through long dry aisles carpeted with a deep prickly mould. On the further edge of this broad hill-back they stayed their march and
crawled for hiding underneath a tangled knot of thorns. Their twisted
boughs, stooping to the ground, were overridden by a clambering maze of old
briars. Deep inside there was a hollow hall, raftered with dead branch and
bramble, and roofed with the first leaves and shoots of spring. There they
lay for a while, too tired yet to eat; and peering out through the holes in
the covert they watched for the slow growth of day. But no day came, only a dead brown twilight. In the East there was a
dull red glare under the lowering cloud: it was not the red of dawn. Across
the tumbled lands between, the mountains of the Ephel D®ath frowned at
them, black and shapeless below where night lay thick and did not pass away, above
with jagged tops and edges outlined hard and menacing against the fiery
glow. Away to their right a great shoulder of the mountains stood out, dark
and black amid the shadows, thrusting westward. 'Which way do we go from here?' asked Frodo. 'Is that the opening of-of
the Morgul Valley, away over there beyond that black mass?’ 'Need we think about it yet?’ said Sam, 'Surely we're not going to move
any more today, if day it is?' 'Perhaps not, perhaps not,’ said Gollum. 'But we must go soon, to the
Cross-roads. Yes, to the Cross-roads. That's the way over there yes,
Master.' The red glare over Mordor died away. The twilight deepened as great
vapours rose in the East and crawled above them. Frodo and Sam took a little
food and then lay down, but Gollum was restless. He would not eat any of
their food, but he drank a little water and then crawled about under the
bushes, sniffing and muttering. Then, suddenly he disappeared. 'Off hunting, I suppose,' said Sam and yawned. It was his turn to sleep
first, and he was soon deep in a dream. He thought he was back in the Bag
End garden looking for something; but he had a heavy pack on his back, which
made him stoop. It all seemed very weedy and rank somehow, and thorns and
bracken were invading the beds down near the bottom hedge. 'A job of work for me, I can see; but I'm so tired,' he kept on saying.
Presently he remembered what he was looking for. 'My pipe!' he said, and
with that he woke up. 'Silly!' he said to himself, as he opened his eyes and wondered why he
was lying down under the hedge. 'It's in your pack all the time!' Then he
realized, first that the pipe might be in his pack but he had no leaf, and
next that he was hundreds of miles from Bag End. He sat up. It seemed to be
almost dark. Why had his master let him sleep on out of turn, right on till
evening? 'Haven't you had no sleep, Mr. Frodo?' he said. 'What's the time? Seems
to be getting late!' 'No it isn't,' said Frodo. 'But the day is getting darker instead of
lighter: darker and darker. As far as I can tell, it isn't midday yet, and
you've only slept for about three hours.' 'I wonder what's up,' said Sam. 'Is there a storm coming? If so it's
going to be the worst there ever was. We shall wish we were down a deep
hole, not just stuck under a hedge.' He listened. 'What's that? Thunder, or
drums, or what is it? ' 'I don't know,' said Frodo. 'It's been going on for a good while now.
Sometimes the ground seems to tremble, sometimes it seems to be the heavy
air throbbing in your ears.' Sam looked round. 'Where's Gollum? ' he said. 'Hasn't he come back
yet?' 'No,' said Frodo. 'There's not been a sign or sound of him.' 'Well, I can't abide him,' said Sam. 'In fact, I've never taken
anything on a journey that I'd have been less sorry to lose on the way. But
it would be just like him, after coming all these miles, to go and get lost
now, just when we shall need him most — that is, if he's ever going to be
any use, which I doubt.' 'You forget the Marshes,' said Frodo. I hope nothing has happened to
him.' 'And I hope he's up to no tricks. And anyway I hope he doesn't fall
into other hands, as you might say. Because if he does, we shall soon be in
for trouble.' At that moment a rolling and rumbling noise was heard again, louder now
and deeper. The ground seemed to quiver under their feet. 'I think we are in
for trouble anyhow,’ said Frodo. 'I'm afraid our journey is drawing to an
end.’ ’Maybe,’ said Sam; 'but where there's life there's hope , as my Gaffer
used to say; and need of vittles, as he mostway s used to add. You have a
bite, Mr. Frodo, and then a bit of sleep.’ The afternoon, as Sam supposed it must be called, wore on. Looking out
from the covert he could see only a dun, shadowless world, fading slowly
into a featureless, colourless gloom. It felt stifling but not warm. Frodo
slept unquietly, turning and tossing, and sometimes murmuring. Twice Sam
thought he heard him speaking Gandalf s name. The time seemed to drag
interminably. Suddenly Sam heard a hiss behind him, and there was Gollum
on all fours, peering at them with gleaming eyes. 'Wake up, wake up! Wake up, sleepies!’ he whispered. 'Wake up! No time
to lose. We must go, yes, we must go at once. No time to lose!’ Sam stared at him suspiciously: he seemed frightened or excited. 'Go
now? What’s your little game? It isn’t time yet. It can’t be tea-time even,
leastways not in decent places where there is tea-time.’ 'Silly! ’ hissed Gollum. 'We’re not in decent places. Time's running
short, yes, running fast. No time to lose. We must go. Wake up. Master, wake
u He clawed at Frodo; and Frodo, startled out of sleep, sat up suddenly and
seized him by the arm. Gollum tore himself loose and backed away. 'They mustn't be silly,' he hissed. 'We must go. No time to lose!’ And
nothing more could they get out of him. Where he had been, and what he
thought was brewing to make him in such a hurry, he would not say. Sam was
filled with deep suspicion, and showed it; but Frodo gave no sign of what
was passing in his mind. He sighed, hoisted his pack, and prepared to go out
into the ever -gathering darkness. Very stealthily Gollum led them down the hillside, keeping under cover
wherever it was possible, and running, almost bent to the ground, across any
open space; but the light was now so dim that even a keen-eyed beast of the
wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits, hooded, in their grey cloaks, nor
heard them, walking as warily as the little people can. Without the crack of
a twig or the rustle of a leaf they passed and vanished. For about an hour they went on, silently, in single file, oppressed by
the gloom and by the absolute stillness of the land, broken only now and
again by the faint rumbling as of thunder far away or drum-beats in some
hollow of the hills. Down from their hiding-place they went, and then
turning south they steered as straight a course as Gollum could find across
a long broken slope that leaned up towards the mountains. Presently, not far
ahead, looming up like a black wall, they saw a belt of trees. As they drew
nearer they became aware that these were of vast size, very ancient it
seemed, and still towering high, though their tops were gaunt and broken, as
if tempest and lightning-blast had swept across them, but had failed to kill
them or to shake their fathomless roots. The Cross-roads, yes,' whispered Gollum, the first words that had been
spoken since they left their hiding-place. 'We must go that way.' Turning
eastward now, he led them up the slope; and then suddenly there it was
before them: the Southward Road, winding its way about the outer feet of the
mountains, until presently it plunged into the great ring of trees. This is the only way,' whispered Gollum. 'No paths beyond the road. No
paths. We must go to the Cross-roads. But make haste! Be silent! ' As furtively as scouts within the campment of their enemies, they crept
down on to the road, and stole along its westward edge under the stony bank,
grey as the stones themselves, and soft-footed as hunting cats. At length
they reached the trees, and found that they stood in a great roofless ring,
open in the middle to the sombre sky; and the spaces between their immense
boles were like the great dark arches of some ruined hall. In the very
centre four ways met. Behind them lay the road to the Morannon; before them
it ran out again upon its long journey south; to their right the road from
old Osgiliath came climbing up, and crossing, passed out eastward into
darkness: the fourth way, the road they were to take. Standing there for a moment filled with dread Frodo became aware that a
light was shining; he saw it glowing on Sam's face beside him. Turning
towards it, he saw, beyond an arch of boughs, the road to Osgiliath running
almost as straight as a stretched ribbon down, down, into the West. There,
far away, beyond sad Gondor now overwhelmed in shade, the Sun was
sinking, finding at last the hem of the great slow-rolling pall of cloud, and falling
in an ominous fire towards the yet unsullied Sea. The brief glow fell upon a
huge sitting figure, still and solemn as the great stone kings of Argonath. The years had gnawed it, and violent hands had maimed it. Its head was gone,
and in its place was set in mockery a round rough-hewn stone, rudely painted
by savage hands in the likeness of a grinning face with one large red eye in
the midst of its forehead. Upon its knees and mighty chair, and all about
the pedestal, were idle scrawls mixed with the foul symbols that the
maggot-folk of Mordor used. Suddenly, caught by the level beams, Frodo saw the old king's head: it
was lying rolled away by the roadside. 'Look, Sam!’ he cried, startled into
speech. 'Look! The king has got a crown again!' The eyes were hollow and the carven beard was broken, but about the
high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold. A trailing plant
with flowers like small white stars had bound itself across the brows as if
in reverence for the fallen king, and in the crevices of his stony hair
yellow stonecrop gleamed. 'They cannot conquer for ever!' said Frodo. And then suddenly the brief
glimpse was gone. The Sun dipped and vanished, and as if at the shuttering
of a lamp, black night fell.
Chapter 8 . The Stairs of Cirith Ungol Gollum was tugging at Frodo's cloak and hissing with fear and
impatience. 'We must go,' he said. 'We mustn’t stand here. Make haste!’ Reluctantly Frodo turned his back on the West and followed as his guide
led him, out into the darkness of the East. They left the ring of trees and
crept along the road towards the mountains. This road, too, ran straight for
a while, but soon it began to bend away southwards, until it came right
under the great shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distance. Black
and forbidding it loomed above them, darker than the dark sky behind.
Crawling under its shadow the road went on, and rounding it sprang east
again and began to climb steeply. Frodo and Sam were plodding along with heavy hearts, no longer able to
care greatly about their peril. Frodo’s head was bowed; his burden was
dragging him down again. As soon as the great Cross-roads had been passed,
the weight of it, almost forgotten in Ithilien, had begun to grow once more.
Now, feeling the way become steep before his feet, he looked wearily up; and
then he saw it, even as Gollum had said that he would: the city of the
Ringwraiths. He cowered against the stony bank. A long-tilted valley, a deep gulf of shadow, ran back far into the
mountains. Upon the further side, some way within the valley's arms high on
a rocky seat upon the black knees of the Ephel D®ath, stood the walls and
tower of Minas Morgul. All was dark about it, earth and sky, but it was lit
with light. Not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of
Minas Ithil long ago, Tower of the Moon, fair and radiant in the hollow of
the hills. Paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse was the
light of it now, wavering and blowing like a noisome exhalation of decay, a
corpse-light, a light that illuminated nothing. In the walls and tower
windows showed, like countless black holes looking inward into emptiness;
but the topmost course of the tower revolved slowly, first one way and then
another, a huge ghostly head leering into the night. For a moment the three
companions stood there, shrinking, staring up with unwilling eyes. Gollum
was the first to recover. Again he pulled at their cloaks urgently, but he
spoke no word. Almost he dragged them forward. Every step was reluctant, and
time seemed to slow its pace, so that between the raising of a foot and the
setting of it down minutes of loathing passed. So they came slowly to the white bridge. Here the road, gleaming
faintly, passed over the stream in the midst of the valley, and went on,
winding deviously up towards the city’s gate: a black mouth opening in the
outer circle of the northward walls. Wide flats lay on either bank, shadowy
meads filled with pale white flowers. Luminous these were too, beautiful and
yet horrible of shape, like the demented forms in an uneasy dream; and they
gave forth a faint sickening charnel-smell; an odour of rottenness filled
the air. From mead to mead the bridge sprang. Figures stood there at its
head, carven with cunning in forms human and bestial, but all corrupt and
loathsome. The water flowing beneath was silent, and it steamed, but the
vapour that rose from it, curling and twisting about the bridge, was deadly
cold. Frodo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening. Then suddenly,
as if some force were at work other than his own will, he began to hurry,
tottering forward, his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to
side. Both Sam and Gollum ran after him. Sam caught his master in his arms,
as he stumbled and almost fell, right on the threshold of the bridge. 'Not that way! No, not that way! ' whispered Gollum, but the breath
between his teeth seemed to tear the heavy stillness like a whistle, and he
cowered to the ground in terror. 'Hold up, Mr. Frodo! ’ muttered Sam in Frodo’s ear. ’Come back! Not
that way. Gollum says not, and for once I agree with him.’ Frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away from the
city on the hill. The luminous tower fascinated him, and he fought the
desire that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate. At last
with an effort he turned back, and as he did so, he felt the Ring resisting
him, dragging at the chain about his neck; and his eyes too, as he looked
away, seemed for the moment to have been blinded. The darkness before him
was impenetrable. Gollum, crawling on the ground like a frightened animal, was already
vanishing into the gloom. Sam, supporting and guiding his stumbling master,
followed after him as quickly as he could. Not far from the near bank of the
stream there was a gap in the stone-wall beside the road. Through this they
passed, and Sam saw that they were on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at
first, as the main road did, until climbing above the meads of deadly
flowers it faded and went dark, winding its crooked way up into the northern
sides of the valley.
Along this path the hobbits trudged, side by side, unable to see Gollum
in front of them, except when he turned back to beckon them on. Then his
eyes shone with a green-white light, reflecting the noisome Morgul-sheen
perhaps, or kindled by some answering mood within. Of that deadly gleam and
of the dark eyeholes Frodo and Sam were always conscious, ever glancing
fearfully over their shoulders, and ever dragging their eyes back to find
the darkening path. Slowly they laboured on. As they rose above the stench
and vapours of the poisonous stream their breath became easier and their
heads clearer; but now their limbs were deadly tired, as if they had walked
all night under a burden, or had been swimming long against a heavy tide of
water. At last they could go no further without a halt. Frodo stopped and sat down on a stone. They had now climbed up to the
top of a great hump of bare rock. Ahead of them there was a bay in the
valley -side, and round the head of this the path went on, no more than a
wide ledge with a chasm on the right; across the sheer southward face of the
mountain it crawled upwards, until it disappeared into the blackness above. 'I must rest a while, Sam,' whispered Frodo. 'It's heavy on me, Sam
lad, very heavy. I wonder how far I can carry it? Anyway I must rest before
we venture on to that.' He pointed to the narrow way ahead. 'Sssh! ssh! ' hissed Gollum hurrying back to them. 'Sssh! ' His fingers
were on his lips and he shook his head urgently. Tugging at Frodo's sleeve,
he pointed towards the path; but Frodo would not move. 'Not yet,' he said, 'not yet.' Weariness and more than weariness
oppressed him; it seemed as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind and body. 'I must rest,’ he muttered. At this Gollum's fear and agitation became so great that he spoke
again, hissing behind his hand, as if to keep the sound from unseen
listeners in the air. 'Not here, no. Not rest here. Fools! Eyes can see us. When they come to the bridge they will see us. Come away! Climb, climb!
Come! ' 'Come, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'He's right, again. We can't stay here.' 'All right,' said Frodo in a remote voice, as of one speaking half
asleep. 'I will try.' Wearily he got to his feet. But it was too late. At that moment the rock quivered and trembled
beneath them. The great rumbling noise, louder than ever before, rolled in
the ground and echoed in the mountains. Then with searing suddenness there
came a great red flash. Far beyond the eastern mountains it leapt into the
sky and splashed the lowering clouds with crimson. In that valley of shadow
and cold deathly light it seemed unbearably violent and fierce. Peaks of
stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out in staring black against the
uprushing flame in Gorgoroth. Then came a great crack of thunder. And Minas Morgul answered. There was a flare of livid lightnings: forks
of blue flame springing up from the tower and from the encircling hills into
the sullen clouds. The earth groaned; and out of the city there came a cry.
Mingled with harsh high voices as of birds of prey, and the shrill neighing
of horses wild with rage and fear, there came a rending screech, shivering,
rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing. The hobbits
wheeled round towards it, and cast themselves down, holding their hands upon
their ears. As the terrible cry ended, falling back through a long sickening wail
to silence, Frodo slowly raised his head. Across the narrow valley, now
almost on a level with his eyes, the walls of the evil city stood, and its
cavernous gate, shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teeth, was gaping
wide. And out of the gate an army came. All that host was clad in sable, dark as the night. Against the wan
walls and the luminous pavement of the road Frodo could see them, small
black figures in rank upon rank, marching swiftly and silently, passing
outwards in an endless stream. Before them went a great cavalry of horsemen
moving like ordered shadows, and at their head was one greater than all the
rest: a Rider, all black, save that on his hooded head he had a helm like a
crown that flickered with a perilous light. Now he was drawing near the
bridge below, and Frodo's staring eyes followed him, unable to wink or to
withdraw. Surely there was the Lord of the Nine Riders returned to earth to
lead his ghastly host to battle? Here, yes here indeed was the haggard king
whose cold hand had smitten down the Ring-bearer with his deadly knife. The
old wound throbbed with pain and a great chill spread towards Frodo's heart. Even as these thoughts pierced him with dread and held him bound as
with a spell, the Rider halted suddenly, right before the entrance of the
bridge, and behind him all the host stood still. There was a pause, a dead
silence. Maybe it was the Ring that called to the Wraith-lord, and for a
moment he was troubled, sensing some other power within his valley. This way
and that turned the dark head helmed and crowned with fear, sweeping the
shadows with its unseen eyes. Frodo waited, like a bird at the approach of a
snake, unable to move. And as he waited, he felt, more urgent than ever
before, the command that he should put on the Ring. But great as the
pressure was, he felt no inclination now to yield to it. He knew that the
Ring would only betray him, and that he had not, even if he put it on, the
power to face the Morgul-king-not yet. There was no longer any answer to
that command in his own will, dismayed by terror though it was, and he felt
only the beating upon him of a great power from outside. It took his hand,
and as Frodo watched with his mind, not willing it but in suspense (as if he
looked on some old story far away), it moved the hand inch by inch towards
the chain upon his neck. Then his own will stirred; slowly it forced the
hand back, and set it to find another thing, a thing lying hidden near his
breast. Cold and hard it seemed as his grip closed on it: the phial of
Galadriel, so long treasured, and almost forgotten till that hour. As he
touched it, for a while all thought of the Ring was banished from his mind. He sighed and bent his head. At that moment the Wraith-king turned and spurred his horse and rode
across the bridge, and all his dark host followed him. Maybe the elven-hoods
defied his unseen eyes, and the mind of his small enemy; being strengthened,
had turned aside his thought. But he was in haste. Already the hour had
struck, and at his great Master's bidding he must march with war into the
West. Soon he had passed, like a shadow into shadow, down the winding road,
and behind him still the black ranks crossed the bridge. So great an army
had never issued from that vale since the days of Isildur's might; no host
so fell and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of Anduin; and yet it
was but one and not the greatest of the hosts that Mordor now sent forth. Frodo stirred. And suddenly his heart went out to Faramir. 'The storm
has burst at last,' he thought. 'This great array of spears and swords is
going to Osgiliath. Will Faramir get across in time? He guessed it, but did
he know the hour? And who can now hold the fords when the King of the
Nine Riders comes? And other armies will come. I am too late. All is lost. I
tarried on the way. All is lost. Even if my errand is performed, no one will
ever know. There will be no one I can tell. It will be in vain.' Overcome
with weakness he wept. And still the host of Morgul crossed the bridge. Then at a great distance, as if it came out of memories of the Shire,
some sunlit early morning, when the day called and doors were opening, he
heard Sam's voice speaking. 'Wake up, Mr. Frodo! Wake up! ’ Had the voice
added: 'Your breakfast is ready,' he would hardly have been surprised.
Certainly Sam was urgent. 'Wake up, Mr. Frodo! They're gone,' he said. There was a dull clang. The gates of Minas Morgul had closed. The last
rank of spears had vanished down the road. The tower still grinned across
the valley, but the light was fading in it. The whole city was falling back
into a dark brooding shade, and silence. Yet still it was filled with
watchfulness. 'Wake up, Mr. Frodo! They're gone, and we'd better go too. There's
something still alive in that place, something with eyes, or a seeing mind,
if you take me; and the longer we stay in one spot, the sooner it will get
on to us. Come on, Mr. Frodo! ' Frodo raised his head, and then stood up. Despair had not left him, but
the weakness had passed. He even smiled grimly, feeling now as clearly as a
moment before he had felt the opposite, that what he had to do, he had to
do, if he could, and that whether Faramir or Aragorn or Elrond or Galadriel
or Gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose. He took
his staff in one hand and the phial in his other. When he saw that the clear
light was already welling through his fingers, he thrust it into his bosom
and held it against his heart. Then turning from the city of Morgul, now no
more than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf, he prepared to take the upward
road. Gollum, it seemed, had crawled off along the ledge into the darkness
beyond, when the gates of Minas Morgul opened, leaving the hobbits where
they lay. He now came creeping back, his teeth chattering and his fingers
snapping. 'Foolish! Silly! ’ he hissed. 'Make haste! They mustn't think
danger has passed. It hasn't. Make haste! ' They did not answer, but they followed him on to the climbing ledge. It
was little to the liking of either of them, not even after facing so many
other perils; but it did not last long. Soon the path reached a rounded
angle where the mountain-side swelled out again, and there it suddenly
entered a narrow opening in the rock. They had come to the first stair that
Gollum had spoken of. The darkness was almost complete, and they could see
nothing much beyond their hands' stretch; but Gollum's eyes shone pale,
several feet above, as he turned back towards them. 'Careful! ' he whispered. 'Steps. Lots of steps. Must be careful! ' Care was certainly needed. Frodo and Sam at first felt easier, having
now a wall on either side, but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder,
and as they climbed up and up, they became more and more aware of the long
black fall behind them. And the steps were narrow, spaced unevenly, and
often treacherous: they were worn and smooth at the edges, and some were
broken, and some cracked as foot was set upon them. The hobbits struggled
on, until at last they were clinging with desperate fingers to the steps
ahead, and forcing their aching knees to bend and straighten; and ever as
the stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountain the rocky walls rose
higher and higher above their heads. At length, just as they felt that they could endure no more, they saw
Gollum's eyes peering down at them again. 'We're up,’ he whispered. ’First
stair's past. Clever hobbits to climb so high, very clever hobbits. Just a
few more little steps and that's all, yes.' Dizzy and very tired Sam, and Frodo following him, crawled up the last
step, and sat down rubbing their legs and knees. They were in a deep dark
passage that seemed still to go up before them, though at a gentler slope
and without steps. Gollum did not let them rest long. 'There's another stair still,' he said. 'Much longer stair. Rest when
we get to the top of next stair. Not yet.’ Sam groaned. ’Longer, did you say? ’ he asked. 'Yes, yess, longer,' said Gollum. 'But not so difficult. Hobbits have
climbed the Straight Stair. Next comes the Winding Stair.’ 'And what after that? ' said Sam. 'We shall see,' said Gollum softly. 'O yes, we shall see! ’ ’I thought you said there was a tunnel,' said Sam. 'Isn't there a
tunnel or something to go through? ' 'O yes, there's a tunnel,' said Gollum. 'But hobbits can rest before
they try that. If they get through that, they'll be nearly at the top. Very
nearly, if they get through. O yes ! ' Frodo shivered. The climb had made him sweat, but now he felt cold and
clammy, and there was a chill draught in the dark passage, blowing down from
the invisible heights above. He got up and shook himself. 'Well, let's go
on! 'he said. 'This is no place to sit in.’ The passage seemed to go on for miles, and always the chill air flowed
over them, rising as they went on to a bitter wind. The mountains seemed to
be trying with their deadly breath to daunt them, to turn them back from the
secrets of the high places, or to blow them away into the darkness behind.
They only knew that they had come to the end, when suddenly they felt no
wall at their right hand. They could see very little. Great black shapeless
masses and deep grey shadows loomed above them and about them, but now
and again a dull red light flickered up under the lowering clouds, and for a
moment they were aware of tall peaks, in front and on either side, like
pillars holding up a vast sagging roof. They seemed to have climbed up many
hundreds of feet, on to a wide shelf. A cliff was on their left and a chasm
on their right. Gollum led the way close under the cliff. For the present they were no
longer climbing, but the ground was now more broken and dangerous in the
dark, and there were blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way. Their
going was slow and cautious. How many hours had passed since they had
entered the Morgul Vale neither Sam nor Frodo could any longer guess. The
night seemed endless. At length they were once more aware of a wall looming up, and once more
a stairway opened before them. Again they halted, and again they began to
climb. It was a long and weary ascent; but this stairway did not delve into
the mountain -side. Here the huge cliff face sloped backwards, and the path
like a snake wound to and fro across it. At one point it crawled sideways
right to the edge of the dark chasm, and Frodo glancing down saw below him
as a vast deep pit the great ravine at the head of the Morgul Valley. Down
in its depths glimmered like a glow-worm thread the wraith-road from the
dead city to the Nameless Pass. He turned hastily away. Still on and up the stairway bent and crawled, until at last with a
final flight, short and straight, it climbed out again on to another level. The path had veered away from the main pass in the great ravine, and it now
followed its own perilous course at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the
higher regions of the Ephel D®ath. Dimly the hobbits could discern tall
piers and jagged pinnacles of stone on either side, between which were great
crevices and fissures blacker than the night, where forgotten winters had
gnawed and carved the sunless stone. And now the red light in the sky seemed
stronger; though they could not tell whether a dreadful morning were indeed
coming to this place of shadow, or whether they saw only the flame of some
great violence of Sauron in the torment of Gorgoroth beyond. Still far
ahead, and still high above, Frodo, looking up, saw, as he guessed, the very
crown of this bitter road. Against the sullen redness of the eastern sky a
cleft was outlined in the topmost ridge, narrow, deep-cloven between two
black shoulders; and on either shoulder was a horn of stone. He paused and looked more attentively. The horn upon the left was tall
and slender; and in it burned a red light, or else the red light in the land
beyond was shining through a hole. He saw now: it was a black tower poised
above the outer pass. He touched Sam's arm and pointed. 'I don’t like the look of that! ' said Sam. 'So this secret way of
yours is guarded after all,' he growled, turning to Gollum. 'As you knew all
along, I suppose? ' 'All ways are watched, yes,' said Gollum. 'Of course they are. But
hobbits must try some way. This may be least watched. Perhaps they've all
gone away to big battle, perhaps ! ' 'Perhaps,' grunted Sam. 'Well, it still seems a long way off, and a
long way up before we get there. And there's still the tunnel. I think you
ought to rest now, Mr. Frodo. I don't know what time of day or night it is,
but we've kept going for hours and hours.' 'Yes, we must rest,’ said Frodo. 'Let us find some corner out of the
wind, and gather our strength-for the last lap.' For so he felt it to be. The terrors of the land beyond, and the deed to be done there, seemed
remote, too far off yet to trouble him. All his mind was bent on getting
through or over this impenetrable wall and guard. If once he could do that
impossible thing, then somehow the errand would be accomplished, or so it
seemed to him in that dark hour of weariness, still labouring in the stony
shadows under Cirith Ungol. In a dark crevice between two great piers of rock they sat down: Frodo
and Sam a little way within, and Gollum crouched upon the ground near the
opening. There the hobbits took what they expected would be their last meal
before they went down into the Nameless Land, maybe the last meal they
would ever eat together. Some of the food of Gondor they ate, and wafers of the
waybread of the Elves, and they drank a little. But of their water they were
sparing and took only enough to moisten their dry mouths. 'I wonder when we'll find water again? ' said Sam. 'But I suppose even
over there they drink? Ores drink, don't they? ' 'Yes, they drink,' said Frodo. 'But do not let us speak of that. Such
drink is not for us.' 'Then all the more need to fill our bottles,' said Sam. 'But there
isn't any water up here: not a sound or a trickle have I heard. And anyway
Faramir said we were not to drink any water in Morgul.' 'No water flowing out of Imlad Morgul, were his words,' said Frodo. 'We
are not in that valley now, and if we came on a spring it would be flowing
into it and not out of it.' 'I wouldn't trust it,' said Sam, 'not till I was dying of thirst. There's a wicked feeling about this place.' Fie sniffed. 'And a smell, I
fancy. Do you notice it? A queer kind of a smell, stuffy. I don't like it.' 'I don't like anything here at all.' said Frodo, 'step or stone, breath
or bone. Earth, air and water all seem accursed. But so our path is laid.’ 'Yes, that's so,' said Sam. 'And we shouldn't be here at all, if we'd
known more about it before we started. But I suppose it's often that way.
The brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo: adventures, as I
used to call them. I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk
of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because
they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might
say. But that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or
the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them,
usually — their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they
had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they
had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten. We hear about
those as just went on — and not all to a good end, mind you; at least not
to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know,
coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same — like
old Mr Bilbo. But those aren't always the best tales to hear, though they
may be the best tales to get landed in! I wonder what sort of a tale we've
fallen into? ' 'I wonder,' said Frodo. 'But I don't know. And that's the way of a real
tale. Take any one that you're fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of
a tale it is, happy-ending or sad-ending, but the people in it don't know. And you don't want them to.' 'No, sir, of course not. Beren now, he never thought he was going to
get that Silmaril from the Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet he did, and
that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours. But that's a long
tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it
— and the Silmaril went on and came to Edrendil. And why, sir, I never
thought of that before! We've got — you've got some of the light of it in
that star-glass that the Lady gave you! Why, to think of it, we're in the
same tale still! It's going on. Don't the great tales never end? ' 'No, they never end as tales,' said Frodo. 'But the people in them
come, and go when their part's ended. Our part will end later — or sooner.' 'And then we can have some rest and some sleep,' said Sam. He laughed
grimly. 'And I mean just that, Mr. Frodo. I mean plain ordinary rest, and
sleep, and waking up to a morning's work in the garden. I'm afraid that's
all I'm hoping for all the time. All the big important plans are not for my
sort. Still, I wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or tales. We're in
one, or course; but I mean: put into words, you know, told by the fireside,
or read out of a great big book with red and black letters, years and years
afterwards. And people will say: "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring! " And
they'll say: "Yes, that's one of my favourite stories. Frodo was very brave,
wasn't he, dad?" "Yes, my boy, the famousest of the hobbits, and that's
saying a lot.'" 'It's saying a lot too much,' said Frodo, and he laughed, a long clear
laugh from his heart. Such a sound had not been heard in those places since
Sauron came to Middle-earth. To Sam suddenly it seemed as if all the stones
were listening and the tall rocks leaning over them. But Frodo did not heed
them; he laughed again. 'Why, Sam,' he said, 'to hear you somehow makes me
as merry as if the story was already written. But you've left out one of the
chief characters: Samwise the stouthearted. "I want to hear more about Sam,
dad. Why didn't they put in more of his talk, dad? That's what I like, it
makes me laugh. And Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam, would he,
dad? ft f 'Now, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, 'you shouldn't make fun. I was serious. ' 'So was I,' said Frodo, 'and so I am. We're going on a bit too fast. You and I, Sam, are still stuck in the worst places of the story, and it is
all too likely that some will say at this point: "Shut the book now, dad; we
don't want to read any more." ' 'Maybe,' said Sam, 'but I wouldn't be one to say that. Things done and
over and made into part of the great tales are different. Why, even Gollum
might be good in a tale, better than he is to have by you, anyway. And he
used to like tales himself once, by his own account. I wonder if he thinks
he's the hero or the villain? 'Gollum!' he called. 'Would you like to be the hero — now where's he
got to again?'
There was no sign of him at the mouth of their shelter nor in the
shadows near. He had refused their food, though he had, as usual, accepted a
mouthful of water; and then he had seemed to curl up for a sleep: They had
supposed that one at any rate of his objects in his long absence the day
before had been to hunt for food to his own liking; and now he had evidently
slipped off again while they talked. But what for this time? 'I don't like his sneaking off without saying,' said Sam. 'And least of
all now. He can't be looking for food up here, not unless there's some kind
of rock he fancies. Why, there isn't even a bit of moss! ' "It's no good worrying about him now,' said Frodo. 'We couldn't have
got so far, not even within sight of the pass, without him, and so we'll
have to put up with his ways. If he's false, he's false.' 'All the same, I'd rather have him under my eye,' said Sam. 'All the
more so, if he's false. Do you remember he never would say if this pass was
guarded or no? And now we see a tower there — and it may be deserted, and
it may not. Do you think he's gone to fetch them, Ores or whatever they
are?' 'No, I don't think so,' answered Frodo. 'Even if he's up to some
wickedness, and I suppose that's not unlikely, I don't think it's that: not
to fetch Ores, or any servants of the Enemy. Why wait till now, and go
through all the labour of the climb, and come so near the land he fears? He
could probably have betrayed us to Ores many times since we met him. No, if
it's anything, it will be some little private trick of his own-that he
thinks is quite secret.' 'Well, I suppose you're right, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'Not that it
comforts me mightily. I don't make no mistake: I don't doubt he'd hand me
over to Ores as gladly as kiss his hand. But I was forgetting — his
Precious. No, I suppose the whole time it's been The Precious for poor
Smjagol. That's the one idea in all his little schemes, if he has any. But
how bringing us up here will help him in that is more than I can guess.' 'Very likely he can't guess himself,' said Frodo. 'And I don't think
he's got just one plain scheme in his muddled head. I think he really is in
part trying to save the Precious from the Enemy, as long as he can. For that
would be the last disaster for himself too. if the Enemy got it. And in the
other part, perhaps, he's just biding his time and waiting on chance.' 'Yes, Slinker and Stinker, as I've said before,' said Sam. 'But the
nearer they get to the Enemy's land the more like Stinker Slinker will get.
Mark my words: if ever we get to the pass, he won't let us really take the
precious thing over the border without making some kind of trouble.' 'We haven't got there yet,' said Frodo. 'No, but we'd better keep our eyes skinned till we do. If we're caught
napping, Stinker will come out on top pretty quick. Not but what it would be
safe for you to have a wink now, master. Safe, if you lay close to me. I'd
be dearly glad to see you have a sleep. I'd keep watch over you; and anyway,
if you lay near, with my arm round you, no one could come pawing you
without your Sam knowing it.' 'Sleep!' said Frodo and sighed, as if out of a desert he had seen a
mirage of cool green. 'Yes, even here I could sleep.' 'Sleep then, master! Lay your head in my lap.' And so Gollum found them hours later, when he returned, crawling and
creeping down the path out of the gloom ahead. Sam sat propped against the
stone, his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy. In his lap lay
Frodo's head, drowned deep in sleep; upon his white forehead lay one of
Sam's brown hands, and the other lay softly upon his master's breast. Peace
was in both their faces. Gollum looked at them. A strange expression passed over his lean hungry
face. The gleam faded from his eyes, and they went dim and grey, old and
tired. A spasm of pain seemed to twist him, and he turned away, peering back
up towards the pass, shaking his head, as if engaged in some interior
debate. Then he came back, and slowly putting out a trembling hand, very
cautiously he touched Frodo's knee — but almost the touch was a caress. For
a fleeting moment, could one of the sleepers have seen him, they would have
thought that they beheld an old weary hobbit, shrunken by the years that had
carried him far beyond his time, beyond friends and kin, and the fields and
streams of youth, an old starved pitiable thing. But at that touch Frodo stirred and cried out softly in his sleep, and
immediately Sam was wide awake. The first thing he saw was Gollum —
'pawing at master,’ as he thought. 'Hey you!’ he said roughly. 'What are you up to?’ 'Nothing, nothing,' said Gollum softly. 'Nice Master!' 'I daresay,' said Sam. 'But where have you been to — sneaking off and
sneaking back, you old villain? '
Gollum withdrew himself, and a green glint flickered under his heavy
lids. Almost spider -like he looked now, crouched back on his bent limbs,
with his protruding eyes. The fleeting moment had passed, beyond recall.
'Sneaking, sneaking!' he hissed. 'Hobbits always so polite, yes. O nice
hobbits! Smjagol brings them up secret ways that nobody else could find.
Tired he is, thirsty he is, yes thirsty; and he guides them and he searches
for paths, and they say sneak, sneak. Very nice friends, O yes my precious,
very nice.' Sam felt a bit remorseful, though not more trustful. 'Sorry.' he said. 'I'm sorry, but you startled me out of my sleep. And I shouldn't have been
sleeping, and that made me a bit sharp. But Mr. Frodo. he's that tired, I
asked him to have a wink; and well, that's how it is. Sorry. But where have
you been to? ' 'Sneaking,' said Gollum, and the green glint did not leave his eyes. 'O very well,' said Sam, 'have it your own way! I don't suppose it's so
far from the truth. And now we'd better all be sneaking along together.
What's the time? Is it today or tomorrow? ' 'It's tomorrow,' said Gollum, 'or this was tomorrow when hobbits went
to sleep. Very foolish, very dangerous-if poor Smjagol wasn't sneaking about
to watch.' 'I think we shall get tired of that word soon,’ said Sam. 'But never
mind. I'll wake master up.' Gently he smoothed the hair back from Frodo's
brow, and bending down spoke softly to him. 'Wake up, Mr. Frodo! Wake up! ' Frodo stirred and opened his eyes, and smiled, seeing Sam's face
bending over him. 'Calling me early aren't you, Sam?' he said. 'It's dark
still! ' 'Yes it's always dark here,' said Sam. 'But Gollum' s come back Mr.
Frodo, and he says it's tomorrow. So we must be walking on. The last lap.' Frodo drew a deep breath and sat up. 'The last lap! ’ he said. 'Hullo,
Smjagol! Found any food? Have you had any rest? ' 'No food, no rest, nothing for Smjagol,' said Gollum. 'He's a sneak.' Sam clicked his tongue, but restrained himself. 'Don't take names to yourself, Smjagol,' said Frodo. 'It's unwise
whether they are true or false.' 'Smjagol has to take what's given him,' answered Gollum. 'He was given
that name by kind Master Samwise, the hobbit that knows so much.'
Frodo looked at Sam. 'Yes sir,' he said. 'I did use the word, waking up
out of my sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand. I said I was sorry,
but I soon shan't be.' 'Come, let it pass then,' said Frodo. 'But now we seem to have come to
the point, you and I, Smjagol. Tell me. Can we find the rest of the way by
ourselves? We're in sight of the pass, of a way in, and if we can find it
now, then I suppose our agreement can be said to be over. You have done what
you promised, and you're free: free to go back to food and rest, wherever
you wish to go, except to servants of the Enemy. And one day I may reward
you, I or those that remember me.' 'No, no, not yet,' Gollum whined. 'O no! They can't find the way
themselves, can they? O no indeed. There's the tunnel coming. Smjagol must
go on. No rest. No food. Not yet.'
Chapter 9 . Shelob ' s Lair It may indeed have been daytime now, as Gollum said, but the hobbits
could see little difference, unless, perhaps, the heavy sky above was less
utterly black, more like a great roof of smoke; while instead of the
darkness of deep night, which lingered still in cracks and holes, a grey
blurring shadow shrouded the stony world about them. They passed on,
Gollum in front and the hobbits now side by side, up the long ravine between the
piers and columns of torn and weathered rock, standing like huge unshapen
statues on either hand. There was no sound. Some way ahead, a mile or so,
perhaps, was a great grey wall, a last huge upthrusting mass of
mountain- stone. Darker it loomed, and steadily it rose as they approached,
until it towered up high above them, shutting out the view of all that lay
beyond. Deep shadow lay before its feet. Sam sniffed the air. 'Ugh! That smell!' he said. 'It's getting stronger and stronger.' Presently they were under the shadow, and there in the midst of it they
saw the opening of a cave. 'This is the way in,' said Gollum softly. 'This
is the entrance to the tunnel.' He did not speak its name: Torech Ungol,
Shelob's Lair. Out of it came a stench, not the sickly odour of decay in the
meads of Morgul, but a foul reek, as if filth unnameable were piled and
hoarded in the dark within. 'Is this the only way, Smjagol? ’ said Frodo. 'Yes, yes,' he answered. 'Yes, we must go this way now.' 'D'you mean to say you've been through this hole?' said Sam. 'Phew! But
perhaps you don't mind bad smells.' Gollum's eyes glinted. 'He doesn't know what we minds, does he
precious? No, he doesn't. But Smjagol can bear things. Yes. He's been
through. O yes, right through. It's the only way.' 'And what makes the smell, I wonder,' said Sam. 'It's like — well, I
wouldn't like to say. Some beastly hole of the Ores, I'll warrant, with a
hundred years of their filth in it.' 'Well,' said Frodo, 'Ores or no, if it's the only way, we must take
it.' Drawing a deep breath they passed inside. In a few steps they were in
utter and impenetrable dark. Not since the lightless passages of Moria had
Frodo or Sam known such darkness, and if possible here it was deeper and
denser. There, there were airs moving, and echoes, and a sense of space. Here the air was still, stagnant, heavy, and sound fell dead. They walked as
it were in a black vapour wrought of veritable darkness itself that, as it
was breathed, brought blindness not only to the eyes but to the mind, so
that even the memory of colours and of forms and of any light faded out of
thought. Night always had been, and always would be, and night was all. But for a while they could still feel, and indeed the senses of their
feet and fingers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully. The walls felt,
to their surprise, smooth, and the floor, save for a step now and again, was
straight and even, going ever up at the same stiff slope. The tunnel was
high and wide, so wide that, though the hobbits walked abreast, only
touching the side- walls with their outstretched hands, they were separated,
cut off alone in the darkness. Gollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead. While
they were still able to give heed to such things, they could hear his breath
hissing and gasping just in front of them. But after a time their senses
became duller, both touch and hearing seemed to grow numb, and they kept on,
groping, walking, on and on, mainly by the force of the will with which they
had entered, will to go through and desire to come at last to the high gate
beyond. Before they had gone very far, perhaps, but time and distance soon
passed out of his reckoning, Sam on the right, feeling the wall, was aware
that there was an opening at the side: for a moment he caught a faint breath
of some air less heavy, and then they passed it by. 'There's more than one passage here,' he whispered with an effort: it
seemed hard to make his breath give any sound. 'It's as ore-like a place as
ever there could be ! ' After that, first he on the right, and then Frodo on the left, passed
three or four such openings, some wider, some smaller; but there was as yet
no doubt of the main way, for it was straight, and did not turn, and still
went steadily up. But how long was it, how much more of this would they have
to endure, or could they endure? The breathlessness of the air was growing
as they climbed; and now they seemed often in the blind dark to sense some
resistance thicker than the foul air. As they thrust forward they felt
things brush against their heads, or against their hands, long tentacles, or
hanging growths perhaps: they could not tell what they were. And still the
stench grew. It grew, until almost it seemed to them that smell was the only
clear sense left t0 them, and that was for their torment. One hour, two
hours, three hours: how many had they passed in this lightless hole?
Hours-days, weeks rather. Sam left the tunnel-side and shrank towards Frodo,
and their hands met and clasped, and so together they still went on. At length Frodo, groping along the left-hand wall, came suddenly to a
void. Almost he fell sideways into the emptiness. Here was some opening in
the rock far wider than any they had yet passed; and out of it came a reek
so foul, and a sense of lurking malice so intense, that Frodo reeled. And at
that moment Sam too lurched and fell forwards. Fighting off both the sickness and the fear, Frodo gripped Sam's hand.
'Up! ' he said in a hoarse breath without voice. 'It all comes from here,
the stench and the peril. Now for it! Quick! ' Calling up his remaining strength and resolution, he dragged Sam to his
feet, and forced his own limbs to move. Sam stumbled beside him. One step,
two steps, three steps-at last six steps. Maybe they had passed the dreadful
unseen opening, but whether that was so or not, suddenly it was easier to
move, as if some hostile will for the moment had released them. They
struggled on, still hand in hand. But almost at once they came to a new difficulty. The tunnel forked, or
so it seemed, and in the dark they could not tell which was the wider way,
or which kept nearer to the straight. Which should they take, the left, or
the right? They knew of nothing to guide them, yet a false choice would
almost certainly be fatal. 'Which way has Gollum gone? ' panted Sam. 'And why didn't he wait? ' 'Smjagol! ’said Frodo, trying to call. ’Smjagol! ’ But his voice
croaked, and the name fell dead almost as it left his lips. There was no
answer, not an echo, not even a tremor of the air. 'He's really gone this time, I fancy,' muttered Sam. 'I guess this is
just exactly where he meant to bring us. Gollum! If ever I lay hands on you
again, you'll be sorry for it.' Presently, groping and fumbling in the dark, they found that the
opening on the left was blocked: either it was a blind, or else some great
stone had fallen in the passage. 'This can't be the way,' Frodo whispered.
'Right or wrong, we must take the other.' 'And quick! ' Sam panted. 'There's something worse than Gollum about. I
can feel something looking at us.' They had not gone more than a few yards when from behind them came a
sound, startling and horrible in the heavy padded silence: a gurgling,
bubbling noise, and a long venomous hiss. They wheeled round, but nothing
could be seen. Still as stones they stood, staring, waiting for they did not
know what. 'It's a trap!’ said Sam, and he laid his hand upon the hilt of his
sword; and as he did so, he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it
came. ’I wish old Tom was near us now!’ he thought. Then as he stood,
darkness about him and a blackness of despair and anger in his heart, it
seemed to him that he saw a light: a light in his mind, almost unbearably
bright at first, as a sun-ray to the eyes of one long hidden in a windowless
pit. Then the light became colour: green, gold, silver, white. Far off, as
in a little picture drawn by elven-fingers he saw the Lady Galadriel
standing on the grass in Lurien, and gifts were in her hands. And you,
Ring-bearer, he heard her say, remote but clear , for you I have prepared
this. The bubbling hiss drew nearer, and there was a creaking as of some
great jointed thing that moved with slow purpose in the dark. A reek came on
before it. 'Master, master!' cried Sam, and the life and urgency came back
into his voice. 'The Lady's gift! The star-glass! A light to you in dark
places, she said it was to be. The star-glass! ' 'The star-glass?' muttered Frodo, as one answering out of sleep, hardly
comprehending. 'Why yes! Why had I forgotten it? A light when all other
lights go out! And now indeed light alone can help us.’ Slowly his hand went to his bosom, and slowly he held aloft the Phial
of Galadriel. For a moment it glimmered, faint as a rising star struggling
in heavy earthward mists, and then as its power waxed, and hope grew in
Frodo's mind, it began to burn, and kindled to a silver flame, a minute
heart of dazzling light, as though Edrendil had himself come down from the
high sunset paths with the last Silmaril upon his brow. The darkness receded
from it until it seemed to shine in the centre of a globe of airy crystal,
and the hand that held it sparkled with white fire. Frodo gazed in wonder at this marvellous gift that he had so long
carried, not guessing its full worth and potency. Seldom had he remembered
it on the road, until they came to Morgul Vale, and never had he used it for
fear of its revealing light. Aiya Edrendil Elenion Ancalima! he cried, and
knew not what he had spoken; for it seemed that another voice spoke through
his, clear, untroubled by the foul air of the pit. But other potencies there are in Middle-earth, powers of night, and
they are old and strong. And She that walked in the darkness had heard the
Elves cry that cry far back in the deeps of time, and she had not heeded it,
and it did not daunt her now. Even as Frodo spoke he felt a great malice
bent upon him, and a deadly regard considering him. Not far down the tunnel,
between them and the opening where they had reeled and stumbled, he was
aware of eyes growing visible, two great clusters of many-windowed eyes —
the coming menace was unmasked at last. The radiance of the star-glass was
broken and thrown back from their thousand facets, but behind the glitter a
pale deadly fire began steadily to glow within, a flame kindled in some deep
pit of evil thought. Monstrous and abominable eyes they were, bestial and
yet filled with purpose and with hideous delight, gloating over their prey
trapped beyond all hope of escape. Frodo and Sam, horror-stricken, began slowly to back away, their own
gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful eyes; but as they backed so
the eyes advanced. Frodo's hand wavered, and slowly the Phial drooped. Then
suddenly, released from the holding spell to run a little while in vain
panic for the amusement of the eyes, they both turned and fled together; but
even as they ran Frodo looked back and saw with terror that at once the eyes
came leaping up behind. The stench of death was like a cloud about him. ’Stand! stand! ' he cried desperately. 'Running is no use.’ Slowly the eyes crept nearer. 'Galadriel! ' he called, and gathering his courage he lifted up the
Phial once more. The eyes halted. For a moment their regard relaxed, as if
some hint of doubt troubled them. Then Frodo's heart flamed within him, and
without thinking what he did, whether it was folly or despair or courage, he
took the Phial in his left hand, and with his right hand drew his sword. Sting flashed out, and the sharp elven-blade sparkled in the silver light,
but at its edges a blue fire flicked. Then holding the star aloft and the
bright sword advanced, Frodo, hobbit of the Shire, walked steadily down to
meet the eyes. They wavered. Doubt came into them as the light approached. One by one
they dimmed, and slowly they drew back. No brightness so deadly had ever
afflicted them before. From sun and moon and star they had been safe
underground, but now a star had descended into the very earth. Still it
approached, and the eyes began to quail. One by one they all went dark; they
turned away, and a great bulk, beyond the light's reach, heaved its huge
shadow in between. They were gone. 'Master, master!' cried Sam. He was close behind, his own sword drawn
and ready. 'Stars and glory! But the Elves would make a song of that, if
ever they heard of it! And may I live to tell them and hear them sing. But
don't go on, master. Don't go down to that den! Now's our only chance. Now
let's get out of this foul hole!' And so back they turned once more, first walking and then running; for
as they went the floor of the tunnel rose steeply, and with every stride
they climbed higher above the stenches of the unseen lair, and strength
returned to limb and heart. But still the hatred of the Watcher lurked
behind them, blind for a while, perhaps, but undefeated, still bent on
death. And now there came a flow of air to meet them, cold and thin. The
opening, the tunnel's end, at last it was before them. Panting, yearning for
a roofless place, they flung themselves forward, and then in amazement they
staggered, tumbling back. The outlet was blocked with some barrier, but not
of stone: soft and a little yielding it seemed, and yet strong and
impervious; air filtered through, hut not a glimmer of any light. Once more
they charged and were hurled back. Holding aloft the Phial Frodo looked and before him he saw a greyness
which the radiance of the star -glass did not pierce and did not illuminate,
as if it were a shadow that being cast by no light, no light could
dissipate. Across the width and height of the tunnel a vast web was spun,
orderly as the web of some huge spider, but denser-woven and far greater,
and each thread was as thick as rope. Sam laughed grimly. 'Cobwebs!' he said. 'Is that all? Cobwebs! But
what a spider! Have at 'em, down with 'em! ' In a fury he hewed at them with his sword, but the thread that he
struck did not break. It gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked
bowstring, turning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm. Three times
Sam struck with all his force, and at last one single cord of all the
countless cords snapped and twisted, curling and whipping through the air.
One end of it lashed Sam's hand, and he cried out in pain, starting back and
drawing his hand across his mouth. 'It will take days to clear the road like this,' he said. 'What's to be
done? Have those eyes come back? '
'No, not to be seen,' said Frodo. 'But I still feel that they are
looking at me, or thinking about me: making some other plan, perhaps. If
this light were lowered, or if it failed, they would quickly come again.' 'Trapped in the end! ' said Sam bitterly, his anger rising again above
weariness and despair. 'Gnats in a net. May the curse of Faramir bite that
Gollum and bite him quick! ’ 'That would not help us now,' said Frodo. 'Come! Let us see what Sting
can do. It is an elven-blade. There were webs of horror in the dark ravines
of Beleriand where it was forged. But you must be the guard and hold back
the eyes. Here, take the star-glass. Do not be afraid. Hold it up and
watch!' Then Frodo stepped up to the great grey net, and hewed it with a wide
sweeping stroke, drawing the bitter edge swiftly across a ladder of
close-strung cords, and at once springing away. The blue-gleaming blade
shore through them like a scythe through grass, and they leaped and writhed
and then hung loose. A great rent was made. Stroke after stroke he dealt, until at last all the web within his
reach was shattered, and the upper portion blew and swayed like a loose veil
in the incoming wind. The trap was broken. 'Come! ' cried Frodo. 'On! On! ' Wild joy at their escape from the very
mouth of despair suddenly filled all his mind. His head whirled as with a
draught of potent wine. He sprang out, shouting as he came. It seemed light in that dark land to his eyes that had passed through
the den of night. The great smokes had risen and grown thinner, and the last
hours of a sombre day were passing; the red glare of Mordor had died away in
sullen gloom. Yet it seemed to Frodo that he looked upon a morning of sudden
hope. Almost he had reached the summit of the wall. Only a little higher
now. The Cleft, Cirith Ungol, was before him, a dim notch in the black
ridge, and the horns of rock darkling in the sky on either side. A short
race, a sprinter's course and he would be through! 'The pass, Sam! ’ he cried, not heeding the shrillness of his voice,
that released from the choking airs of the tunnel rang out now high and
wild. 'The pass ! Run, run, and we'll be through-through before any one can
stop us! ' Sam came up behind as fast as he could urge his legs; but glad as he
was to be free, he was uneasy, and as he ran, he kept on glancing back at
the dark arch of the tunnel, fearing to see eyes, or some shape beyond his
imagining, spring out in pursuit. Too little did he or his master know of
the craft of Shelob. She had many exits from her lair. There agelong she had dwelt, an evil thing in spider-form, even such as
once of old had lived in the Land of the Elves in the West that is now under
the Sea, such as Beren fought in the Mountains of Terror in Doriath, and so
came to L®thien upon the green sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight
long ago. How Shelob came there, flying from ruin, no tale tells, for out of the
Dark Years few tales have come. But still she was there, who was there
before Sauron, and before the first stone of Barad-dyr; and she served none
but herself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat with
endless brooding on her feasts, weaving webs of shadow; for all living
things were her food, and her vomit darkness. Far and wide her lesser
broods, bastards of the miserable mates, her own offspring, that she slew,
spread from glen to glen, from the Ephel D®ath to the eastern hills, to Dol
Guldur and the fastnesses of Mirkwood. But none could rival her, Shelob the
Great, last child of Ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world. Already, years before, Gollum had beheld her, Smjagol who pried into
all dark holes, and in past days he had bowed and worshipped her, and the
darkness of her evil will walked through all the ways of his weariness
beside him, cutting him off from light and from regret. And he had promised
to bring her food. But her lust was not his lust. Little she knew of or
cared for towers, or rings, or anything devised by mind or hand, who only
desired death for all others, mind and body, and for herself a glut of life,
alone, swollen till the mountains could no longer hold her up and the
darkness could not contain her. But that desire was yet far away, and long now had she been hungry,
lurking in her den, while the power of Sauron grew, and light and living
things forsook his borders; and the city in the valley was dead, and no Elf
or Man came near, only the unhappy Ores. Poor food and wary. But she must
eat, and however busily they delved new winding passages from the pass and
from their tower, ever she found some way to snare them. But she lusted for
sweeter meat. And Gollum had brought it to her. 'We'll see, we’ll see,' he said often to himself, when the evil mood
was on him, as he walked the dangerous road from Emyn Muil to Morgul
Vale, 'we'll see. It may well be, O yes, it may well be that when She throws away
the bones and the empty garments, we shall find it, we shall get it, the
Precious, a reward for poor Smjagol who brings nice food. And we'll save the
Precious, as we promised. O yes. And when we’ve got it safe, then She'll
know it, O yes, then we'll pay Her back, my precious. Then we'll pay
everyone back! ' So he thought in an inner chamber of his cunning, which he still hoped
to hide from her, even when he had come to her again and had bowed low
before her while his companions slept. And as for Sauron: he knew where she lurked. It pleased him that she
should dwell there hungry but unabated in malice, a more sure watch upon
that ancient path into his land than any other that his skill could have
devised. And Ores, they were useful slaves, but he had them in plenty. If
now and again Shelob caught them to stay her appetite, she was welcome: he
could spare them. And sometimes as a man may cast a dainty to his cat ( his
cat he calls her, but she owns him not) Sauron would send her prisoners that
he had no better uses for: he would have them driven to her hole, and report
brought back to him of the play she made. So they both lived, delighting in their own devices, and feared no
assault, nor wrath, nor any end of their wickedness. Never yet had any fly
escaped from Shelob's webs, and the greater now was her rage and hunger. But nothing of this evil which they had stirred up against them did
poor Sam know, except that a fear was growing on him, a menace which he
could not see; and such a weight did it become that it was a burden to him
to run, and his feet seemed leaden. Dread was round him, and enemies before him in the pass, and his master
was in a fey mood running heedlessly to meet them. Turning his eyes away
from the shadow behind and the deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left,
he looked ahead, and he saw two things that increased his dismay. He saw
that the sword which Frodo still held unsheathed was glittering with blue
flame; and he saw that though the sky behind was now dark, still the window
in the tower was glowing red. 'Ores!' he muttered. 'We'll never rush it like this. There's Ores
about, and worse than Ores.' Then returning quickly to his long habit of
secrecy, he closed his hand about the precious Phial which he still bore. Red with his own living blood his hand shone for a moment, and then he
thrust the revealing light deep into a pocket near his breast and drew his
elven-cloak about him. Now he tried to quicken his pace. His master was
gaining on him; already he was some twenty strides ahead, flitting on like a
shadow; soon he would be lost to sight in that grey world. Hardly had Sam hidden the light of the star-glass when she came. A
little way ahead and to his left he saw suddenly, issuing from a black hole
of shadow under the cliff, the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld,
horrible beyond the horror of an evil dream. Most like a spider she was, but
huger than the great hunting beasts, and more terrible than they because of
the evil purpose in her remorseless eyes. Those same eyes that he had
thought daunted and defeated, there they were lit with a fell light again,
clustering in her out-thrust head. Great horns she had, and behind her short
stalk -like neck was her huge swollen body, a vast bloated bag, swaying and
sagging between her legs; its great bulk was black, blotched with livid
marks, but the belly underneath was pale and luminous and gave forth a
stench. Her legs were bent, with great knobbed joints high above her back,
and hairs that stuck out like steel spines, and at each leg’s end there was
a claw. As soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body and its folded
limbs out of the upper exit from her lair, she moved with a horrible speed,
now running on her creaking legs, now making a sudden bound. She was
between Sam and his master. Either she did not see Sam, or she avoided him for the
moment as the bearer of the light' and fixed all her intent upon one prey,
upon Frodo, bereft of his Phial, running heedless up the path, unaware yet
of his peril. Swiftly he ran, but Shelob was swifter; in a few leaps she
would have him. Sam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout. 'Look out
behind! ' he yelled. ’Look out master! I'm' — but suddenly his cry was
stifled. A long clammy hand went over his mouth and another caught him by the
neck, while something wrapped itself about his leg. Taken off his guard he
toppled backwards into the arms of his attacker. 'Got him! ' hissed Gollum in his ear. 'At last, my precious, we’ve got
him, yes, the nassty hobbit. We takes this one. She'll get the other. O yes,
Shelob will get him, not Smjagol: he promised; he won't hurt Master at all.
But he's got you, you nassty filthy little sneak!' He spat on Sam's neck. Fury at the treachery, and desperation at the delay when his master was
in deadly peril, gave to Sam a sudden violence and strength that was far
beyond anything that Gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit, as he
thought him. Not Gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more
fiercely. His hold on Sam's mouth slipped, and Sam ducked and lunged
forward again, trying to tear away from the grip on his neck. His sword was still in
his hand, and on his left arm, hanging by its thong, was Faramir's staff.
Desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy. But Gollum was too quick.
His long right arm shot out, and he grabbed Sam's wrist: his fingers were
like a vice; slowly and relentlessly he bent the hand down and forward, till
with a cry of pain Sam released the sword and it fell to the ground; and all
the while Gollum's other hand was tightening on Sam's throat. Then Sam played his last trick. With all his strength he pulled away
and got his feet firmly planted; then suddenly he drove his legs against the
ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwards. Not expecting even this simple trick from Sam, Gollum fell over with
Sam on top, and he received the weight of the sturdy hobbit in his stomach. A sharp hiss came out of him, and for a second his hand upon Sam's throat
loosened; but his fingers still gripped the sword-hand. Sam tore himself
forward and away, and stood up, and then quickly he wheeled away to his
right, pivoted on the wrist held by Gollum. Laying hold of the staff with
his left hand, Sam swung it up, and down it came with a whistling crack on
Gollum's outstretched arm, just below the elbow. With a squeal Gollum let go. Then Sam waded in; not waiting to change
the staff from left to right he dealt another savage blow. Quick as a snake
Gollum slithered aside, and the stroke aimed at his head fell across his
back. The staff cracked and broke. That was enough for him. Grabbing from
behind was an old game of his, and seldom had he failed in it. But this
time, misled by spite, he had made the mistake of speaking and gloating
before he had both hands on his victim's neck. Everything had gone wrong
with his beautiful plan, since that horrible light had so unexpectedly
appeared in the darkness. And now he was face to face with a furious enemy,
little less than his own size. This fight was not for him. Sam swept up his
sword from the ground and raised it. Gollum squealed, and springing aside on
to all fours, he jumped away in one big bound like a frog. Before Sam could
reach him, he was off, running with amazing speed back towards the tunnel. Sword in hand Sam went after him. For the moment he had forgotten
everything else but the red fury in his brain and the desire to kill Gollum.
But before he could overtake him, Gollum was gone. Then as the dark hole
stood before him and the stench came out to meet him, like a clap of thunder
the thought of Frodo and the monster smote upon Sam's mind. He spun round,
and rushed wildly up the path, calling and calling his master's name. He was
too late. So far Gollum's plot had succeeded.
Chapter 10. The Choices of Master Samwise Frodo was lying face upward on the ground and the monster was bending
over him, so intent upon her victim that she took no heed of Sam and his
cries, until he was close at hand. As he rushed up he saw that Frodo was
already bound in cords, wound about him from ankle to shoulder, and the
monster with her great forelegs was beginning half to lift, half to drag his
body away. On the near side of him lay, gleaming on the ground, his elven-blade,
where it had fallen useless from his grasp. Sam did not wait to wonder what
was to be done, or whether he was brave, or loyal, or filled with rage. He
sprang forward with a yell, and seized his master's sword in his left hand.
Then he charged. No onslaught more fierce was ever seen in the savage world
of beasts; where some desperate small creature armed with little teeth
alone, will spring upon a tower of horn and hide that stands above its
fallen mate. Disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his small yell she turned
slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him. But almost before she was
aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she had known in countless
years, the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw. Sam
sprang in, inside the arches of her legs, and with a quick upthrust of his
other hand stabbed at the clustered eyes upon her lowered head. One great
eye went dark. Now the miserable creature was right under her, for the moment out of
the reach of her sting and of her claws. Her vast belly was above him with
its putrid light, and the stench of it almost smote him down. Still his fury
held for one more blow, and before she could sink upon him, smothering him
and all his little impudence of courage, he slashed the bright elven-blade
across her with desperate strength. But Shelob was not as dragons are, no softer spot had she save only her
eyes. Knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age-old hide, but ever
thickened from within with layer on layer of evil growth. The blade scored
it with a dreadful gash, but those hideous folds could not be pierced by any
strength of men, not though Elf or Dwarf should forge the steel or the hand
of Beren or of T®rin wield it. She yielded to the stroke, and then heaved up
the great bag of her belly high above Sam's head. Poison frothed and bubbled
from the wound. Now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on
him again. Too soon. For Sam still stood upon his feet, and dropping his own
sword, with both hands he held the elven-blade point upwards, fending off
that ghastly roof; and so Shelob, with the driving force of her own cruel
will, with strength greater than any warrior's hand, thrust herself upon a
bitter spike. Deep, deep it pricked, as Sam was crushed slowly to the
ground. No such anguish had Shelob ever known, or dreamed of knowing, in all
her long world of wickedness. Not the doughtiest soldier of old Gondor, nor
the most savage Ore entrapped, had ever thus endured her, or set blade to
her beloved flesh. A shudder went through her. Heaving up again, wrenching
away from the pain, she bent her writhing limbs beneath her and sprang
backwards in a convulsive leap. Sam had fallen to his knees by Frodo's head, his senses reeling in the
foul stench, his two hands still gripping the hilt of the sword. Through the
mist before his eyes he was aware dimly of Frodo's face and stubbornly he
fought to master himself and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon
him. Slowly he raised his head and saw her, only a few paces away, eyeing
him, her beak drabbling a spittle of venom, and a green ooze trickling from
below her wounded eye. There she crouched, her shuddering belly splayed
upon the ground, the great bows of her legs quivering, as she gathered herself
for another spring-this time to crush and sting to death: no little bite of
poison to still the struggling of her meat; this time to slay and then to
rend. Even as Sam himself crouched, looking at her, seeing his death in her
eyes, a thought came to him, as if some remote voice had spoken, and he
fumbled in his breast with his left hand, and found what he sought: cold and
hard and solid it seemed to his touch in a phantom world of horror, the
Phial of Galadriel. 'Galadriel! ' he said faintly, and then he heard voices far off but
clear: the crying of the Elves as they walked under the stars in the beloved
shadows of the Shire, and the music of the Elves as it came through his
sleep in the Hall of Fire in the house of Elrond. Gilthoniel A Elberethl
And then his tongue was loosed and his voice cried in a language which
he did not know: A Elbereth Gilthoniel o menel palan-diriel, le nallon sn di'nguruthos! A tiro nin, Fanuilos! And with that he staggered to his feet and was Sam wise the hobbit,
Hamfast's son, again. 'Now come, you filth!' he cried. 'You've hurt my master, you brute, and
you'll pay for it. We're going on; but we'll settle with you first. Come on,
and taste it again!' As if his indomitable spirit had set its potency in motion, the glass
blazed suddenly like a white torch in his hand. It flamed like a star that
leaping from the firmament sears the dark air with intolerable light. No
such terror out of heaven had ever burned in Shelob's face before. The beams
of it entered into her wounded head and scored it with unbearable pain, and
the dreadful infection of light spread from eye to eye. She fell back
beating the air with her forelegs, her sight blasted by inner lightnings,
her mind in agony. Then turning her maimed head away, she rolled aside and
began to crawl, claw by claw, towards the opening in the dark cliff behind. Sam came on. He was reeling like a drunken man, but he came on. And
Shelob cowed at last, shrunken in defeat, jerked and quivered as she tried
to hasten from him. She reached the hole, and squeezing down, leaving a
trail of green-yellow slime, she slipped in, even as Sam hewed a last stroke
at her dragging legs. Then he fell to the ground. Shelob was gone; and whether she lay long in her lair, nursing her
malice and her misery, and in slow years of darkness healed herself from
within, rebuilding her clustered eyes, until with hunger like death she spun
once more her dreadful snares in the glens of the Mountains of Shadow, this
tale does not tell. Sam was left alone. Wearily, as the evening of the Nameless Land fell
upon the place of battle, he crawled back to his master. 'Master, dear master,' he said, but Frodo did not speak. As he had run
forward, eager, rejoicing to be free, Shelob with hideous speed had come
behind and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck. He lay now pale,
and heard no voice, and did not move. 'Master, dear master! ’ said Sam, and through a long silence waited.
listening in vain. Then as quickly as he could he cut away the binding cords and laid his
head upon Frodo's breast and to his mouth, but no stir of life could he
find, nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart. Often he chafed his
master's hands and feet, and touched his brow, but all were cold. 'Frodo, Mr. Frodo! ' he called. 'Don't leave me here alone! It's your
Sam calling. Don't go where I can't follow! Wake up, Mr. Frodo! O wake up,
Frodo, me dear, me dear. Wake up!' Then anger surged over hint, and he ran about his master's body in a
rage, stabbing the air, and smiting the stones, and shouting challenges.
Presently he came back, and bending looked at Frodo's face, pale beneath him
in the dusk. And suddenly he saw that he was in the picture that was
revealed to him in the mirror of Galadriel in Lurien: Frodo with a pale face
lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Or fast asleep he had thought
then. 'He's dead! ' he said. 'Not asleep, dead! ' And as he said it, as if
the words had set the venom to its work again, it seemed to him that the hue
of the face grew livid green. And then black despair came down on him, and Sam bowed to the ground,
and drew his grey hood over his head, and night came into his heart, and he
knew no more. When at last the blackness passed, Sam looked up and shadows were about
him; but for how many minutes or hours the world had gone dragging on he
could not tell. He was still in the same place, and still his master lay
beside him dead. The mountains had not crumbled nor the earth fallen into
ruin. 'What shall I do, what shall I do? ' he said. 'Did I come all this way
with him for nothing? ’ And then he remembered his own voice speaking
words that at the time he did not understand himself, at the beginning of their
journey: I have something to do before the end. I must see it through, sir,
if you understand. 'But what can I do? Not leave Mr. Frodo dead, unburied on the top of
the mountains, and go home? Or go on? Go on?’ he repeated, and for a
moment doubt and fear shook him. 'Go on? Is that what I've got to do? And leave
him?' Then at last he began to weep; and going to Frodo he composed his body,
and folded his cold hands upon his breast, and wrapped his cloak about him;
and he laid his own sword at one side, and the staff that Faramir had given
at the other. 'If I’m to go on,' he said, 'then I must take your sword, by your
leave, Mr. Frodo, but I'll put this one to lie by you, as it lay by the old
king in the barrow; and you've got your beautiful mithril coat from old Mr.
Bilbo. And your star-glass, Mr. Frodo, you did lend it to me and I'll need
it, for I'll be always in the dark now. It's too good for me, and the Lady
gave it to you, but maybe she'd understand. Do you understand, Mr. Frodo?
I've got to go on.' But he could not go, not yet. He knelt and held Frodo's hand and could
not release it. And time went by and still he knelt, holding his master's
hand, and in his heart keeping a debate. Now he tried to find strength to tear himself away and go on a lonely
journey — for vengeance. If once he could go, his anger would bear him down
all the roads of the world, pursuing, until he had him at last: Gollum. Then
Gollum would die in a corner. But that was not what he had set out to do. It
would not be worth while to leave his master for that. It would not bring
him back. Nothing would. They had better both be dead together. And that too
would be a lonely journey. He looked on the bright point of the sword. He thought of the places
behind where there was a black brink and an empty fall into nothingness.
There was no escape that way. That was to do nothing, not even to grieve.
That was not what he had set out to do. 'What am I to do then? ' he cried
again, and now he seemed plainly to know the hard answer: see it through.
Another lonely journey, and the worst. 'What? Me, alone, go to the Crack of Doom and all? ' He quailed still,
but the resolve grew. 'What? Me take the Ring from him ? The Council gave it
to him.’ But the answer came at once: 'And the Council gave him companions, so
that the errand should not fail. And you are the last of all the Company. The errand must not fail.' 'I wish I wasn't the last,' he groaned. 'I wish old Gandalf was hare or
somebody. Why am I left all alone to make up my mind? I’m sure to go wrong.
And it's not for me to go taking the Ring, putting myself forward.' 'But you haven't put yourself forward; you've been put forward. And as
for not being the right and proper person, why, Mr. Frodo wasn't as you
might say, nor Mr. Bilbo. They didn’t choose themselves.' 'Ah well, I must make up my own mind. I will make it up. But I'll be
sure to go wrong: that'd be Sam Gamgee all over. 'Let me see now: if we're found here, or Mr. Frodo's found, and that
Thing's on him, well, the Enemy will get it. And that's the end of all of
us, of Lorien, and Rivendell, and the Shire and all. And there s no time to
lose, or it'll be the end anyway. The war's begun, and more than likely
things are all going the Enemy's way already. No chance to go back with It
and get advice or permission. No, it's sit here till they come and kill me
over master's body, and gets It: or take It and go.' He drew a deep breath. 'Then take It, it is ! ' He stooped. Very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and slipped his
hand inside Frodo's tunic; then with his other hand raising the head, he
kissed the cold forehead, and softly drew the chain over it. And then the
head lay quietly back again in rest. No change came over the still face, and
by that more than by all other tokens Sam was convinced at last that Frodo
had died and laid aside the Quest. 'Good-bye, master, my dear! ' he murmured. 'Forgive your Sam. He'll
come back to this spot when the job's done — if he manages it. And then
he'll not leave you again. Rest you quiet till I come; and may no foul
creature come anigh you ! And if the Lady could hear me and give me one wish,
I would wish to come back and find you again. Good-bye! ' And then he bent his own neck and put the chain upon it, and at once
his head was bowed to the ground with the weight of the Ring, as if a great
stone had been strung on him. But slowly, as if the weight became less, or
new strength grew in him, he raised his head, and then with a great effort
got to his feet and found that he could walk and bear his burden. And for a
moment he lifted up the Phial and looked down at his master, and the light
burned gently now with the soft radiance of the evening-star in summer, and
in that light Frodo's face was fair of hue again, pale but beautiful with an
elvish beauty, as of one who has long passed the shadows. And with the
bitter comfort of that last sight Sam turned and hid the light and stumbled
on into the growing dark. He had not far to go. The tunnel was some way behind; the Cleft a
couple of hundred yards ahead, or less. The path was visible in the dusk' a
deep rut worn in ages of passage, running now gently up in a long trough
with cliffs on either side. The trough narrowed rapidly. Soon Sam came to a
long flight of broad shallow steps. Now the ore-tower was right above him,
frowning black, and in it the red eye glowed. Now he was hidden in the dark
shadow under it. He was coming to the top of the steps and was in the Cleft
at last. 'I've made up my mind,' he kept saying to himself. But he had not.
Though he had done his best to think it out, what he was doing was
altogether against the grain of his nature. 'Have I got it wrong? ' he
muttered. 'What ought I to have done? ’ As the sheer sides of the Cleft closed about him, before he reached the
actual summit, before he looked at last on the path descending into the
Nameless Land, he turned. For a moment, motionless in intolerable doubt, he
looked back. He could still see, like a small blot in the gathering gloom,
the mouth of the tunnel; and he thought he could see or guess where Frodo
lay. He fancied there was a glimmer on the ground down there, or perhaps it
was some trick of his tears, as he peered out at that high stony place where
all his life had fallen in ruin. ’If only I could have my wish, my one wish,’ he sighed, 'to go back and
find him!' Then at last he turned to the road in front and took a few
steps: the heaviest and the most reluctant he had ever taken. Only a few steps; and now only a few more and he would be going down
and would never see that high place again. And then suddenly he heard cries
and voices. He stood still as stone. Ore- voices. They were behind him and
before him. A noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts: Ores were coming up
to the Cleft from the far side, from some entry to the tower, perhaps.
Tramping feet and shouts behind. He wheeled round. He saw small red lights,
torches, winking away below there as they issued from the tunnel. At last
the hunt was up. The red eye of the tower had not been blind. He was caught. Now the flicker of approaching torches and the clink of steel ahead was
very near. In a minute they would reach the top and be on him. He had taken
too long in making up his mind, and now it was no good. How could he escape,
or save himself, or save the Ring? The Ring. He was not aware of any thought
or decision. He simply found himself drawing out the chain and taking the
Ring in his hand. The head of the ore-company appeared in the Cleft right
before him. Then he put it on. The world changed, and a single moment of time was filled with an hour
of thought. At once he was aware that hearing was sharpened while sight was
dimmed, but otherwise than in Shelob's lair. All things about him now were
not dark but vague; while he himself was there in a grey hazy world, alone,
like a small black solid rock and the Ring, weighing down his left hand, was
like an orb of hot gold. He did not feel invisible at all, but horribly and
uniquely visible; and he knew that somewhere an Eye was searching for him. He heard the crack of stone, and the murmur of water far off in Morgul
Vale; and down away under the rock the bubbling misery of Shelob, groping,
lost in some blind passage; and voices in the dungeons of the tower; and the
cries of the Ores as they came out of the tunnel; and deafening, roaring in
his ears, the crash of the feet and the rending clamour of the Ores before
him. He shrank against the cliff. But they marched up like a phantom
company, grey distorted figures in a mist, only dreams of fear with pale
flames in their hands. And they passed him by. He cowered, trying to creep
away into some cranny and to hide. He listened. The Ores from the tunnel and the others marching down had
sighted one another, and both parties were now hurrying and shouting. He
heard them both clearly, and he understood what they said. Perhaps the Ring
gave understanding of tongues, or simply understanding, especially of the
servants of Sauron its maker, so that if he gave heed, he understood and
translated the thought to himself. Certainly the Ring had grown greatly in
power as it approached the places of its forging; but one thing it did not
confer, and that was courage. At present Sam still thought only of hiding,
of lying low till all was quiet again; and he listened anxiously. He could
not tell how near the voices were, the words seemed almost in his ears. 'Hola! Gorbag! What are you doing up here? Had enough of war already? ' 'Orders, you lubber. And what are you doing, Shagrat? Tired of lurking
up there? Thinking of coming down to fight? ' 'Orders to you. I'm in command of this pass. So speak civil. What's
your report? ' 'Nothing.' 'Hai! hai! yoi !' A yell broke into the exchanges of the leaders. The
Ores lower down had suddenly seen something. They began to run. So did the
others. 'Hai! Hola! Here's something! Lying right in the road. A spy, a spy! ' There was a hoot of snarling horns and a babel of baying voices. With a dreadful stroke Sam was wakened from his cowering mood. They
had seen his master. What would they do? He had heard tales of the Ores to make
the blood run cold. It could not be borne. He sprang up. He flung the Quest
and all his decisions away, and fear and doubt with them. He knew now where
his place was and had been: at his master's side, though what he could do
there was not clear. Back he ran down the steps, down the path towards
Frodo. 'How many are there?' he thought. 'Thirty or forty from the tower at
least, and a lot more than that from down below, I guess. How many can I
kill before they get me? They'll see the flame of the sword, as soon as I
draw it, and they'll get me sooner or later. I wonder if any song will ever
mention it: How Samwise fell in the High Pass and made a wall of bodies
round his master. No, no song. Of course not, for the Ring'll be found, and
there'll be no more songs. I can't help it. My place is by Mr. Frodo. They
must understand that — Elrond and the Council, and the great Lords and
Ladies with all their wisdom. Their plans have gone wrong. I can't be their
Ring-bearer. Not without Mr. Frodo.' But the Ores were out of his dim sight now. He had had no time to
consider himself, but now he realized that he was weary, weary almost to
exhaustion: his legs would not carry him as he wished. He was too slow. The
path seemed miles long. Where had they all got to in the mist? There they were again! A good way ahead still. A cluster of figures
round something lying on the ground; a few seemed to be darting this way and
that, bent like dogs on a trail. He tried to make a spurt. 'Come on, Sam! ' he said, 'or you'll be too late again.' He loosened
the sword in its sheath. In a minute he would draw it, and then— There was a wild clamour, hooting and laughing, as something was lifted
from the ground. 'Ya hoi! Ya harri hoi! Up! Up! ' Then a voice shouted: 'Now off! The quick way. Back to the Undergate!
She'll not trouble us tonight by all the signs.' The whole band of
ore-figures began to move. Four in the middle were carrying a body high on
their shoulders. 'Ya hoi! ’ They had taken Frodo's body. They were off. He could not catch them up.
Still he laboured on. The Ores reached the tunnel and were passing in. Those
with the burden went first, and behind them there was a good deal of
struggling and jostling. Sam came on. He drew the sword, a flicker of blue
in his wavering hand, but they did not see it. Even as he came panting up,
the last of them vanished into the black hole. For a moment he stood, gasping, clutching his breast. Then he drew his
sleeve across his face, wiping away the grime, and sweat, and tears. ’Curse
the filth! ' he said, and sprang after them into the darkness. It no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel, rather it was as if
he had stepped out of a thin mist into a heavier fog. His weariness was
growing but his will hardened all the more. He thought he could see the
light of torches a little way ahead, but try as he would, he could not catch
them up. Ores go fast in tunnels, and this tunnel they knew well.; for in
spite of Shelob they were forced to use it often as the swiftest way from
the Dead City over the mountains. In what far-off time the main tunnel and
the great round pit had been made, where Shelob had taken up her abode in
ages past, they did not know: but many byways they had themselves delved
about in on either side, so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro
on the business of their masters. Tonight they did not intend to go far
down, but were hastening to find a side-passage that led back to their
watch-tower on the cliff. Must of them were gleeful, delighted with what
they had found and seen, and as they ran they gabbled and yammered after the
fashion of their kind. Sam heard the noise of their harsh voices, flat and
hard in the dead air, and he could distinguish two voices from among all the
rest: they were louder, and nearer to him. The captains of the two parties
seemed to be bringing up the rear, debating as they went. ’Can't you stop your rabble making such a racket, Shagrat? ' grunted
the one. 'We don’t want Shelob on us.’ 'Go on, Gorbag! Yours are making more than half the noise,’ said the
other. 'But let the lads play! No need to worry about Shelob for a bit, I
reckon. She’s sat on a nail, it seems, and we shan’t cry about that. Didn’t
you see: a nasty mess all the way back to that cursed crack of hers? If
we’ve stopped it once, we’ve stopped it a hundred times. So let ’em laugh.
And we’ve struck a bit of luck at last: got something that Lugb®rz wants.’
’Lugb®rz wants it, eh? What is it, d’you think? Elvish it looked to me,
but undersized. What’s the danger in a thing like that? ’ ’Don’t know till we’ve had a look.’ ’Oho! So they haven’t told you what to expect? They don’t tell us all
they know, do they? Not by half. But they can make mistakes, even the Top
Ones can.’ 'Sh, Gorbag!’ Shagrat’s voice was lowered, so that even with his
strangely sharpened hearing Sam could only just catch what was said. ’They
may, but they’ve got eyes and ears everywhere; some among my lot, as like as
not. But there's no doubt about it, they're troubled about something. The
Nazgyl down below are, by your account; and Lugb®rz is too. Something
nearly
slipped.’ 'Nearly, you say! ’ said Gorbag. 'All right,’ said Shagrat, 'but we’ll talk of that later: Wait till we
get to the Under-way. There’s a place there where we can talk a bit, while
the lads go on.’ Shortly afterwards Sam saw the torches disappear. Then there was a
rumbling noise, and just as he hurried up, a bump. As far as he could guess
the Ores had turned and gone into the very opening which Frodo and he had
tried and found blocked. It was still blocked. There seemed to be a great stone in the way, but the Ores had got
through somehow, for he could hear their voices on the other side. They were
still running along, deeper and deeper into the mountain, back towards the
tower. Sam felt desperate. They were carrying off his master's body for some
foul purpose and he could not follow. He thrust and pushed at the block, and
he threw himself against it, but it did not yield. Then not far inside, or
so he thought, he heard the two captains' voices talking again. He stood
still listening for a little hoping perhaps to learn something useful. Perhaps Gorbag, who seemed to belong to Minas Morgul, would come out, and
he could then slip in. 'No, I don’t know,’ said Gorbag's voice. 'The messages go through
quicker than anything could fly, as a rule. But I don’t enquire how it’s
done. Safest not to. Grr! Those Nazgyl give me the creeps. And they skin the
body off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all cold in the dark on
the other side. But He likes ’em; they’re His favourites nowadays, so it’s
no use grumbling. I tell you, it’s no game serving down in the city.’ 'You should try being up here with Shelob for company,’ said Shagrat. ’I’d like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em. But the war's on
now, and when that's over things may be easier.' 'It's going well, they say.’ 'They would.’ grunted Gorbag. 'We'll see. But anyway, if it does go
well, there should be a lot more room. What d’you say? — if we get a
chance, you and me’ll slip off and set up somewhere on our own with a few
trusty lads, somewhere where there's good loot nice and handy, and no big
bosses.' ’Ah! ' said Shagrat. 'Like old times.' 'Yes,' said Gorbag. 'But don't count on it. I'm not easy in my mind. As
I said, the Big Bosses, ay,' his voice sank almost to a whisper, 'ay, even
the Biggest, can make mistakes. Something nearly slipped you say. I say,
something has slipped. And we've got to look out. Always the poor Uruks to
put slips right, and small thanks. But don't forget: the enemies don't love
us any more than they love Him, and if they get topsides on Him, we're done
too. But see here: when were you ordered out? ' 'About an hour ago, just before you saw us. A message came: Nazgyl
uneasy. Spies feared on Stairs. Double vigilance. Patrol to head of Stairs. I came at once.' 'Bad business,' said Gorbag. 'See here — our Silent Watchers were
uneasy more than two days ago. that I know. But my patrol wasn't ordered out
for another day, nor any message sent to Lugb®rz either: owing to the Great
Signal going up, and the High Nazgyl going off to the war, and all that. And
then they couldn't get Lugb®rz to pay attention for a good while, I'm told.' 'The Eye was busy elsewhere, I suppose,' said Shagrat. 'Big things
going on away west, they say.’ ’I daresay,' growled Gorbag. 'But in the meantime enemies have got up
the Stairs. And what were you up to? You're supposed to keep watch, aren't
you, special orders or no? What are you for?' 'That's enough! Don't try and teach me my job. We were awake all right. We knew there were funny things going on.' 'Very funny! ’ 'Yes, very funny: lights and shouting and all. But Shelob was on the
go. My lads saw her and her Sneak.' 'Her Sneak? What's that? ' 'You must have seen him: little thin black fellow; like a spider
himself, or perhaps more like a starved frog. He's been here before. Came
out of Lugb®rz the first time, years ago, and we had word from High Up to
let him pass. He's been up the Stairs once or twice since then, but we've
left him alone: seems to have some understanding with Her Ladyship. I
suppose he's no good to eat: she wouldn't worry about words from High Up.
But a fine guard you keep in the valley: he was up here a day before all
this racket. Early last night we saw him. Anyway my lads reported that Her
Ladyship was having some fun, and that seemed good enough for me, until the
message came. I thought her Sneak had brought her a toy. or that you'd
perhaps sent her a present, a prisoner of war or something. I don't
interfere when she's playing. Nothing gets by Shelob when she's on the
hunt.' 'Nothing, say you! Didn't you use your eyes back there? I tell you I'm
not easy in my mind. Whatever came up the Stairs, did get by. It cut her web
and got clean out of the hole. That's something to think about! ' 'Ah well, but she got him in the end, didn't she? ' ' Got him? Got whol This little fellow? But if he was the only one then
she'd have had him off to her larder long before, and there he'd be now. And
if Lugb®rz wanted him, you'd have to go and get him. Nice for you. But there
was more than one.' At this point Sam began to listen more attentively and pressed his ear
against the stone. 'Who cut the cords she'd put round him, Shagrat? Same one as cut the
web. Didn't you see that? And who stuck a pin into Her Ladyship? Same one, I
reckon. And where is he? Where is he, Shagrat? ' Shagrat made no reply. 'You may well put your thinking cap on, if you've got one. It's no
laughing matter. No one, no one has ever stuck a pin in Shelob before, as
you should know well enough. There's no grief in that; but think -there's
someone loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned rebel
that ever walked since the bad old times, since the Great Siege. Something
has slipped.' 'And what is it then? ' growled Shagrat. 'By all the signs, Captain Shagrat, I'd say there's a large warrior
loose, Elf most likely, with an elf-sword anyway, and an axe as well maybe:
and he's loose in your bounds, too, and you've never spotted him. Very funny
indeed! ' Gorbag spat. Sam smiled grimly at this description of himself. 'Ah well, you always did take a gloomy view.' said Shagrat. 'You can
read the signs how you like, but there may be other ways to explain them.
Anyhow. I've got watchers at every point, and I'm going to deal with one
thing at a time. When I've had a look at the fellow we have caught, then
I'll begin to worry lcb2
about something else.' It s my guess you won’t find much in that little fellow,' said Gorbag. 'He may have had nothing to do with the real mischief. The big fellow with
the sharp sword doesn't seem to have thought him worth much anyhow — just
left him lying: regular elvish trick.' 'We'll see. Come on now! We've talked enough. Let's go and have a look
at the prisoner! 'What are you going to do with him? Don't forget I spotted him first. If there's any game, me and my lads must be in it.' 'Now, now,' growled Shagrat. 'I have my orders. And it's more than my
belly's worth, or yours, to break 'em. Any trespasser found by the guard is
to be held at the tower. Prisoner is to be stripped.
